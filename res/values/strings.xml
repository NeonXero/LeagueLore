    <string name="dem_story">
        Along the western coast of Valoran, the human city-state of Demacia shines as the continent\’s paragon of
        virtue amongst all the other human settlements. The people of Demacia are driven by their common cause to
        disseminate benevolence and justice for the betterment of all beings throughout Valoran. They view malice and
        selfishness as a disease which should be expunged from the psyche of humankind. Those who come to Demacia and
        choose to settle within the borders of the city-state are expected to share the ideals and virtues of its
        citizenry. Those who seek personal gain at the expense of others quickly find themselves ostracized… or
        worse.\n\nLife in Demacia, however, isn’t one of placid utopian dreams. Since the Demacian people pride
        themselves as the moral vanguards of Valoran, they adopt seemingly draconian measures to ensure that their
        moral code remains the only code by which one may live within the city-state. Crime in any form is harshly
        punished; there are no misdemeanors within Demacia. Some detractors of Demacia (who criticize far from the
        reaches of the city-state) claim this as proof of its inherent hypocrisy. Demacians counter this argument by
        pointing out that their justice system incorporates benevolence and mitigation into its verdicts. No one is
        punished without fair and just consideration of the circumstances involved. While others may continue to
        criticize the harshness of Demacian law, the Demacians stand by their convictions. \n\nDemacia is the only
        government in Valoran run by a constitutional monarchy, wherein the King of Demacia serves as the head of state
        and an elected council serves as the legislative body. While the king is a strong ruler, he is kept in
        check at least partially by the Demacian Council. The current King of Demacia, Jarvan III (a.k.a. Jarvan
        Lightshield the Third), works earnestly with the Demacian Council to ensure that the sanctity of the city-state
        remains pure and true. Since the rule of Jarvan I, there has never been an attempted coup or rebellion of any
        kind in Demacia. The king serves not only as the political leader of the city-state, but also as the
        commander-in-chief of its military. \n\nThe Demacian military is one of the strongest in all of Valoran, and
        until recently it was the only force capable of holding back the hunger of the military machine that is Noxus.
        Noxus has been the sworn enemy of Demacia since both settlements were founded hundreds of years ago. Their
        conflict is at the core a moral one, and with such a night-and-day division of moral philosophy amongst Demacia
        and Noxus, it is not hard to see why Demacia views its military requirements as a vital necessity to survival.
        Every Demacian citizen is required to serve in its military for no fewer than three years. Even after this
        time, most Demacians remain on active status in the city-state’s military reserve.\n\nDemacia was one of the
        first supporters of the League of Legends, though its concerns were less for the planet’s stability and more to
        diminish the Noxian threat to Valoran. Demacia sent its best students of magic to the Institute of
        War, with some of them becoming master summoners. Demacia holds its own in the Fields of Justice, and this has
        subsequently eased the massive expenditure of resources otherwise needed to maintain its military force. The
        post-League Demacian military is as strong as ever, though it has shifted its focus from that
        of a standing invasion force, ready to re-conquest Noxian acquisitions, to that of an impenetrable bastion,
        secure and vigilant across its entire dominion.\n\nDemacia is a shining beacon of hope for humanity,
        and as such the city is the visual representation of this concept. There is a clean and pristine feel and look
        to the city. Towering spires litter the skyline of Demacia. White stone and marble are the materials of choice
        in the construction of Demacian buildings. Majestic flags fly high along the parapets of the city. The city
        walls virtually gleam with power and nobility. The city itself sits next to a natural port,
        with the majority of the city resting on a plateau.
    </string>
    <string name="noxus_story">
        Located on the far central eastern part of the Valoranian continent, the human city-state of Noxus is in many
        ways the moral antithesis of Demacia; it is a settlement where the physically and mentally strong acquire power
        through any means necessary, regardless of the consequences to their fellow humans. The citizenry of Noxus
        generally stands behind this principle, regarding the qualities of benevolence and compassion as signs of
        weakness. Strength begets strength, at least as far as the humans of Noxus are concerned. This seeming cruelty,
        however, is not an indicator of chaos. As is naturally and necessarily the case with humankind, Noxus is an
        orderly city-state, where rules protect the citizenry from harm… at least from their peers. In Noxus, however,
        those with power are clearly protected by the law more than those without it.\n\nThe ruling political
        organization of Noxus is called the Noxian High Command, and it acts as the head of the military. In Noxus, the
        military controls every aspect of the political landscape; there is no separation between the warfare and
        politics. The eternally youthful-looking leader of the High Command, General Boram Darkwill,
        has ruled Noxus for countless years. General Darkwill has far exceeded his average lifespan as a human; it is
        rumored that he is kept alive through necromantic magic. Such a conclusion would seem to make sense, especially
        when considering that he has ruled the Noxian High Command since before the time of King Jarvan I of Demacia.
        His seemingly endless hunger for power and conquest has driven Noxus to be the nightmarish threat to its
        neighbors that it is today. \n\nWhere other human settlements tend to welcome non-humans into their midst,
        Noxians are decidedly xenophobic. Non-humans are, at best, made to feel unwelcome within the borders of this
        city-state. There are exceptions to this, but only after the non-humans in question have proven themselves to
        be either useful or feared (or both). Human visitors and emigrants to Noxus are made to feel only slightly
        better, again proving themselves only by either demonstrating competence or inspiring terror in their enemies.
        \n\nMilitary service in Noxus is compulsory for a period of six years, with all of its citizens retained as
        active reservists until their golden years. The Noxian High Command reserves the right to draft any of its
        citizens, regardless of age, into military service in times of dire need. Active Noxian military personnel are
        afforded a higher level of citizenship in Noxian society, and it is not uncommon for most citizens to remain
        active in the military for ten or more years. There is seldom a lack of work in the Noxian military, even with
        the forced quasi-peace that exists between Noxus and their eternal rivals, the Demacians.\n\nThe Noxian High
        Command strategically elected not to oppose the formation of the League of Legends, and even went as far as to
        give tepid support for its activities. It was clear to Valoran’s power brokers that Noxus could read the
        writing on the wall; to oppose the League, especially with the vast majority of Valoran behind
        its formation, would have been tantamount to suicide. By supporting its formation, Noxus achieved two ends.
        First, Noxus would have some degree of forced peace between itself and Demacia. This would allow Noxus to focus
        its efforts on conquest elsewhere; its track record in this conquest since the formation of the League,
        however, has been considerably underwhelming. Second, Noxus would focus its considerable magic talent into the
        League, allowing for a potentially greater degree of success in conflicts against the Demacians. To date, the
        endless war with Demacia has been just that – endless. The Noxian conflict with Demacia has, for the most part,
        surrogated itself into the Fields of Justice for considerably less cost in material and manpower. While its
        mortal foe has been able to relax some, Noxus has been able to relax considerably more without the iron fist of
        Demacia looming overhead.\n\nNoxus is a city that resembles its inhabitants – dark and sinister. The foundation
        of the city was built into a granite mountain, and a fair portion of the city lies underground. Structures are
        built on top of and into the mountain itself. A tremendous man-made moat, filled with a witches’ brew of foul
        and putrid liquids, circumnavigates the city; the moat serves as an excellent means of cutting off access to
        Noxus through but a few key points, all of which are heavily guarded. At the top of the granite mountain
        resides the headquarters of the Noxian High Command; the building itself vaguely resembles a human skull from a
        distance. Beyond the huge city walls lie those Noxian denizens too poor (or too lucky) to live inside.\n\nThe
        subterranean city level of Noxus is almost as large as the top level, with numerous shops, taverns, and
        residences comprising the seedy underbelly of the notorious city-state. Noxus contains the largest network of
        dungeons anywhere on Runeterra, with numerous Noxian nobles claiming ownership over the various labyrinthine
        passages and subterranean rooms.

    <string name="league_story">
        Until only twenty years ago, Runeterra was on a collision course with disaster. As quickly as Runeterra’s
        denizens would band together in ancient times as tribes, opposing tribes would war to settle their disputes. No
        matter the era, the preferred choice of warfare has always been magical. Armies would be enhanced or decimated
        by spell and rune alike. Champions made the most of magical items forged for them as they led or supported
        armies. Summoners – often the de facto leaders of Valoran’s political forces – would unleash mighty magical
        powers directly against foes and their holdings with little regard for consequence. With such an abundance of
        raw magical power at their disposal, there was little motivation for summoners to explore more
        environmentally-friendly forms of warfare.\n\nWithin the last two hundred years, however, the dangers of
        unchecked magical warfare began to expose the fragility of Runeterra to everyone residing in Valoran. The last
        two Rune Wars drastically altered the geophysical landscape of Valoran, even after magical energy was focused
        on restoring it. Violent earthquakes and horrific magically-fueled storms made life on Valoran challenging,
        even before factoring in the horror of warfare on the populace. It was theorized that another unchecked Rune
        War would tear the world asunder.\n\nAs a direct response to the world’s growing physical and political
        instability, Valoran’s key magicians – including many powerful summoners – came to the conclusion that
        conflicts needed to be resolved in a controllable and systemic way. They formed an organization called the
        League of Legends, whose purpose was to oversee the orderly resolution of political conflict in Valoran. Housed
        in the Institute of War, the League would be given the authority by Valoran’s political entities to govern the
        outcomes of the organized conflict they would administer.\n\nThe League resolved that all major political
        conflict would be settled through the use of specially prepared arenas strategically located throughout
        Valoran. Summoners representing a particular political allegiance would each call forth a champion; the
        champions, leading mindless minions generated by novice summoners manipulating a nexus, would fight to achieve
        the objective of the arena they were in. The most common victory condition of a battle arena would be to
        destroy the opposing faction’s nexus. These arenas are collectively referred to as the Fields of
        Justice.\n\nWhile all major political conflicts were being funneled through the League of Legends, physical
        conflicts between warring political entities were not completely eliminated. For example – the strategic choice
        of the League to build the Institute of War directly between the constantly warring city-states of Demacia and
        Noxus stopped almost all direct confrontation between them, though military skirmishes continue to break out.
        Instead, the warlike Noxian High Command has turned its ambitions of conquest offshore. Even still, all
        political entities abide by the governance of the League of Legends. No wise regent would be foolish enough to
        rail against a vast cabal of immensely powerful magicians, summoners, and champions.\n\nThe fights in the
        various Fields of Justice over which the League presides are not only of great political interest to Valoran,
        but also of great social interest. The League magically transmits the sights and sounds of the action as it
        unfolds to specially built arcane receivers located in key settlements throughout Valoran. Watching a fight
        in a Field of Justice is one of the more popular entertainment activities Valoran’s denizens engage in.\n\nThe
        League of Justice is supervised by a council of three powerful summoners, known as the High Council of Equity.
        Each summoner has been on the Council of Equity since the inception of the League of Legends except for
        its newest High Councilor, Heywan Relivash; High Councilor Relivash’s ascension took place five years ago after
        the mysterious disappearance of the previous High Councilor, Reginald Ashram. The Council of Equity is
        responsible not only for the leadership and guidance of the League, but also to act as the highest court of
        appeal for adjudication of Valoran’s political entities.\n\nThe structure of the League is focused around
        internal organizations that lead their various goals. Each city-state is assigned an Emissary of the League – a
        diplomat who serves as an on-location political representative to enact the will of the League. The
        Adjudicators are the arbiters assigned to a given match in the Fields of Justice. The Council is the body of
        high-ranking summoners which rules over political outcomes once a battle arena match has been resolved.

        <item>Unlike other foxes that roamed the woods of southern Ionia, Ahri had always felt a strange connection to
            the magical world around her; a connection that was somehow incomplete. Deep inside, she felt the skin she
            had been born into was an ill fit for her and dreamt of one day becoming human. Her goal seemed forever out
            of reach, until she happened upon the wake of a human battle. It was a grisly scene, the land obscured by
            the forms of wounded and dying soldiers. She felt drawn to one: a robed man encircled by a waning field of
            magic whose life was quickly slipping away. She approached him and something deep inside of her triggered,
            reaching out to the man in a way she couldn\'t understand. His life essence poured into her, carried on
            invisible strands of magic. The sensation was intoxicating and overwhelming. As her reverie faded, she was
            delighted to discover that she had changed. Her sleek white fur had receded and her body was long and
            lithe…the shape of the humans who lay scattered about her.\n\n

            However, though she appeared human, she knew that in truth the transformation was incomplete. A cunning
            creature, she adapted herself to the customs of human society and used her profound gift of beauty to
            attract unsuspecting men. She could consume their life essences when they were under the spell of her
            seductive charms. Feeding on their desires brought her closer to her dream, but as she took more lives, a
            strange sense of regret began to well within her. She had reservations about actions which never troubled
            her as a fox. She realized that she could not overcome the pangs of her evolving morality. In search of a
            solution, Ahri found the Institute of War, home of the most gifted mages on Runeterra. They offered her a
            chance to attain her humanity without further harm through service in the League of Legends.\n\n

        <item>There exists an ancient order originating in the Ionian Isles dedicated to the
            preservation of balance. Order, chaos, light, darkness -- all things must exist in perfect harmony for such
            is
            the way of the universe. This order is known as the Kinkou and it employs a triumvirate of shadow warriors
            to
            uphold its causes in the world. Akali is one of these shadow warriors, entrusted with the sacred duty of
            Pruning the Tree - eliminating those who threaten the equilibrium of Valoran. \n\nA prodigal martial
            artist,
            Akali began training with her mother as soon as she could make a fist. Her mother\'s discipline was
            relentless
            and unforgiving, but predicated on the fundamental principle: \'We do that which must be done.\' When the
            Kinkou inducted her into the order at the age of fourteen, she could slice a dangling chain with a chop of
            her
            hand. There was no question - she would succeed her mother as the Fist of Shadow. She has had to do much in
            this role which others might find morally questionable, but to her it is in service of her mother\'s
            inviolable
            doctrine. She now works with her fellows Shen and Kennen to enforce the balance of Valoran. This hallowed
            pursuit has unsurprisingly led the triumvirate to the Fields of Justice. \n\n\'The Fist of Shadow strikes
            from
            the cover of death itself. Do not impede the balance.\'

        <item>As the mightiest warrior to ever emerge from the Minotaur tribes of the Great Barrier,
            Alistar defended his tribe from Valoran\'s many dangers; that is, until the coming of the Noxian army.
            Alistar
            was lured from his village by the machinations of Keiran Darkwill, General Boram Darkwill\'s youngest son
            and
            commander of the Noxian expeditionary force. When Alistar returned, he found his village burning and his
            family
            slain. Bellowing with rage, he charged an entire regiment of Noxus\' elite, slaughtering them by the
            hundreds.
            Only the intervention of some of Noxus\' most skilled summoners checked Alistar\'s rage. Brought in chains
            to
            Noxus, Alistar spent the intervening years as a gladiator in the Fleshing, pitted in endless battle for the
            entertainment of Noxus\' wealthy leaders. \n\nAlistar\'s once noble soul slowly became twisted,
            and he would
            have been driven to insanity if not for Ayelia, a young servant girl who befriended him and eventually
            arranged
            for his escape. Suddenly free, Alistar joined the newly formed League of Legends to fight as a champion,
            hoping
            to one day exact his final vengeance upon Noxus and find the girl who had renewed his hope. Initially
            unwilling
            to cater to his celebrity status as a champion, Alistar has since discovered that there is power in fame,
            and he has become a vocal advocate for those whom the Noxian government treads upon. He also calls to light
            things that the Noxian military would prefer remain hidden -- something that has made him very unpopular
            with
            Noxus\' nobles. His charitable work has earned him several philanthropic awards, which serve as an
            interesting
            contrast to the rage and destruction he brings to the League of Legends. \n\nIf you intend to grab the bull
            by
            the horns as a summoner, Alistar might have something to say about that.

        <item>Perhaps one of the oddest champions in the League of Legends is the yordle known as Amumu. His life
            before
            joining the League remains unknown... especially to Amumu. All he remembers is that he woke up alone inside
            a
            pyramid within the Shurima Desert. He was entwined in mummy wrappings and he could not feel his heart beat.
            Furthermore, he felt a deep sadness that he could not entirely explain; he knew he missed his parents,
            though he could not remember who they were. Dropping to his knees, Amumu wept into his bandages. No matter
            what
            he did, it seemed he could never stop his tears or sadness. Eventually he stood up,
            determined to wander the
            world to discover his past. Amumu traveled all across southern Valoran - a feat that is not easily
            dismissed.\n\nWhile Amumu still hasn\'t learned much about his past, he has learned a great deal about who
            he
            has become. He is most assuredly undead, though he harbors none of the evil characteristics typical of

            the
            Institute of War, the home of the League. Amumu\'s story was compelling to the summoners he met there, and
            they
            invited him to take part in a League Judgment. His success within the League as a champion has given Amumu
            something he desired: a home. With his present (un)life secured, he now hopes the friends he has made will

        <item>In most lore, the phoenix is a creature of fire that rises from its own ashes. What few know, however, is
            that
            phoenixes are elemental beings, formed by the eternal essences of their native world. Anivia was conceived
            on a
            world such as this - a being of the coldest winter, a creature of pure elemental ice. On her world, Anivia
            was
            the protector of the frozen wastes and all those with the spirit to endure in such unforgiving places. She
            was
            consulted as a creature of great wisdom, one who could not die and who had seen the world renewed several
            times. Somehow, Anivia knew that the day would come when she would be plucked from her home and pulled
            across
            worlds, and when that day came, she received the call with grace. Seeing the imbalance and injustice on
            Runeterra, a world lacking elemental protectors, Anivia took her place at the League of Legends.\n\nSince
            her
            arrival, the Cryophoenix has chosen to live among the highest peaks of the Northern Ironspike Mountains,
            adjacent to the frozen wastes of Freljord. She has openly claimed this territory as her own protectorate.
            Surprisingly, Anivia has struck up a friendship with the yeti of this region - a friendship that grows
            deeper
            and deeper with each passing moon. She has formed a close bond with two League champions: Nunu (and
            Willump) and the nomad princess Ashe. In a move that caught the League by surprise,
            the Cryophoenix recently
            entreated the summoners of the Institute of War to research a means in bringing across others of her
            elemental
            fellows. As a champion, Anivia is revered with a sense of awe by most, but is not the most popular as most
            consider her unapproachable.\n\nSome say the world will end in fire, some in ice. Anivia awaits the
            inevitable
            latter.

        <item>In the time shortly before the League, there were those within the sinister city-state of Noxus who did
            not
            agree with the evils perpetrated by the Noxian High Command. The High Command had just put down a coup
            attempt
            from the self-proclaimed Crown Prince Raschallion, and a crack down on any form of dissent against the new
            government was underway. These political and social outcasts, known as the Gray Order,
            sought to leave their
            neighbors in peace as they pursued dark arcane knowledge. The leaders of this outcast society were a
            married
            couple: Gregori Hastur, the Gray Warlock, and his wife Amoline, the Shadow Witch. Together they led an
            exodus
            of magicians and other intelligentsia from Noxus, resettling their followers beyond the Great Barrier to
            the
            northern reaches of the unforgiving Voodoo Lands. Though survival was a challenge at times, the Gray
            Order\'s
            colony managed to thrive in a land where so many others would have failed.\n\nYears after the exodus,
            Gregori
            and Amoline had a child: Annie. Early on, Annie\'s parents knew there was something special about their
            daughter. At the age of two, Annie miraculously ensorcelled a shadow bear - a ferocious denizen of the
            petrified forests outside the colony - turning it into her pet. To this day she keeps her bear \'Tibbers\'
            by
            her side, often keeping him spellbound as a stuffed doll to be carried like a child\'s toy. The combination
            of
            Annie\'s lineage and the dark magic of her birthplace have given this little girl tremendous arcane power.
            It
            is this same girl who now finds herself as one of the most sought-after champions within the League of
            Legends - even by the city-state that would have exiled her parents had they not fled beforehand
            .\n\n\'Annie
            may be one of the most powerful champions ever to have fought in a Field of Justice. I shudder to think of
            her
            capabilities when she becomes an adult.\' - High Councilor Kiersta Mandrake

        <item>One of the perennial favorites of summoners in the League of Legends is the Freljordian beauty known as
            Ashe.
            She is a direct descendant of Avarosa - one of three legendary sisters who each claimed dominion over the
            scattered tribes dwelling in the icy tundra of northern Valoran. Ashe mirrors her ancestor\'s unparalleled
            mastery of the bow, earning her the title of \'The Frost Archer\' the way Avarosa did during her era. Ashe
            is a
            literal Princess amongst her people, though she prefers to be addressed by outsiders as her tribal title
            rather
            than any form of royal moniker. There are those in Freljord, however, that would prefer to address Ashe as
            the
            \'late\' Frost Archer; the other two tribes that are descendants from the Three Sisters are historically
            sworn
            enemies of Ashe and her people. Having survived more than one assassination attempt in her life, Ashe is
            always
            aware of her surroundings regardless of where she is.\n\nAshe originally came to the Institute of War in
            service of the League summoners, seeking enough influence and favor to finally bring peace to her realm -
            one
            that has endured civil strife since Avarosa and the Time of the Three Sisters. With countless victories
            under
            her belt, she has started to put the influence she has earned in the League to use. Rumors abound that Ashe
            has
            begun to associate herself with fellow champion Tryndamere outside of the Fields of Justice. While she
            denies
            such talk as frivolous, all eyes will remain on Ashe now that her success in the League may finally allow
            her
            to restore lasting peace to her people.\n\n\'It\'s a good idea to spread out. Ashe can hit five birds with

        <item>The city of Zaun is a place where both magic and science have gone awry. The unchecked nature of
            experimentation has taken its toll on the city. However, Zaun\'s lenient restrictions allow their
            researchers and inventors the leeway to push the bounds of science at an accelerated rate, for better or
            worse. It was under these conditions that a team of doctoral students from Zaun\'s College of Techmaturgy
            made a breakthrough in the field of intelligent steam automation. Their creation, the steam golem
            Blitzcrank, was developed to exercise judgment on-the-fly in order to assist with Zaun\'s hazardous waste
            reclamation process, since so often the conditions did not allow for human supervision. However, he soon
            began exhibiting unforeseen behaviors.\n\n
            Over time, the scientists were able to identify a demonstrated learning process, and Blitzcrank fast became
            a celebrity. As is sadly often the case though, credit for the golem\'s creation was scooped up by
            another -
            Professor Stanwick Pididly - though most now know the truth. In the wake of the ensuing legal maelstrom, it
            became evident that neither party truly had the steam golem\'s best interests at heart, and Blitzcrank
            humbly petitioned for personal autonomy. Backed by overwhelming support from the public,
            it took the liberal
            Council of Zaun only a few weeks to declare Blitzcrank a fully-independent,
            sentient entity. A unique being,
            the golem left Zaun, distressed by the controversy and feeling there was no place he could fit in. His
            travels led him to the one location in Valoran where unique beings have a place - the League of Legends.
            Fortunately, he was easily able to adapt his design to suit the rigors he would face on the Fields of
            Justice.\n\n
            Though Blitzcrank may batter anything that stands in his way, he really has a heart of gold...encased in a
            framework of iron...in a carapace of steel.

        <item>In a faraway place known as Lokfar there was a seafaring marauder called Kegan Rodhe. As was his
            people\'s
            way, Kegan sailed far and wide with his fellows, stealing treasures from those unlucky enough to catch
            their
            attention. To some, he was a monster; to others, just a man. One night, as they sailed through the arctic
            waters, strange lights danced over the frozen wastes. There was something hypnotic about them; it was
            something that drew them to it like moths to a flame. Trekking across the frozen waste, they came to a cave
            covered in ancient runes. The meaning of the runes long lost to them, Kegan led the way inside. There,
            inside a perfect cage of ice floated a dancing column of flame. There was no way such a thing should be
            burning, especially not in this place. However, its movement was as hypnotic as a siren\'s song,
            captivating
            and seductive. While the others stayed back, Kegan could not help but approach it while holding out his
            hand...\n\n

            That is the last thing Kegan Rodhe remembers, for now his body belongs to Brand. It is a creature of olden
            times, perhaps even a casualty of the Rune Wars. It is known in ancient texts as the Burning Vengeance. It
            is a creature of pure fiery hate that exists for no other reason than to lay waste the world of men and
            yordles. No one is quite sure how Brand found his way to Valoran, but he began his predations at once.
            Overcome by Demacian forces, he was given a choice: fight within the confines of the League or die.
            Naturally, he chose to use his destructive powers in the League, for now...\n\n

        <item>One of the reasons Piltover is known as the City of Progress is because it has an extraordinarily low
            crime rate. This hasn\'t always been the case; brigands and thieves of all sorts used to find the
            city-state
            an ideal mark for plunder, primarily due to the valuable resources it imports to fuel its techmaturgical
            research. Some even theorize that it would have fallen long ago to the chaos of organized crime if not for
            Caitlyn, the Sheriff of Piltover. Born the daughter of a wealthy statesman and a pioneering hextech
            researcher, Caitlyn discovered her natural gift for investigation when, at age 14, her father was assaulted
            and robbed on his way home. She snuck out of her house that night with her father\'s rifle and tracked down
            the muggers from the crime scene. At first, her parents did their best to discourage her from such risky
            hobbies, but she was incorrigible. Wishing to protect her daughter in the only way she knew how, Caitlyn\'s
            mother began outfitting her with techmaturgical devices tailored to her sleuthing needs.\n\n

            Caitlyn quickly gained notoriety, both because she was single handedly defeating crime in Piltover and also
            because she soon developed into a ravishing beauty. She never backed down from a case or a challenge, and
            she was one of the sharpest shots in the city-state. Her services were soon requested by Demacia to help
            track down a mysterious outlaw who had begun committing high-profile heists. The bandit, who always left a
            card with an ornate \'C\' at the scene of the crime, became Caitlyn\'s arch-nemesis. To this day, Caitlyn
            still searches for this cat burglar, and the chase has led her all across Valoran. She has joined the
            League
            to hone her skills and gain the influence necessary to track down the only quarry that has managed to evade
            her.\n\n

        <item>While her sister Katarina has always been the most celebrated member of the household, the Du Couteau
            family has a long history of service to Noxus. It has often been said that no soldier has ever been as
            fortunate as General Du Couteau to have been graced with daughters. His youngest, Cassiopeia - despite
            lacking her sister\'s killer instincts - was equally renowned in court for her stately character and
            elegance. Cunning as she was beautiful, the temptress could never be found far from the arm of any foreign
            dignitary, her wiles prying secrets from the lips of even the most wary attache. With the Noxian barbarian
            pacification campaign having ground to a standstill, Cassiopeia had set her sights on a diplomat from a
            tribe of the Freljord region. Thinking him an easy mark, the scheming seductress set about beguiling him.
            He
            refused to confide in her, however, until she swore an oath of secrecy upon his sword - a strange weapon
            with a serpentine curve to the blade.\n\n

            Once her tryst was over, Cassiopeia provisioned her father with information regarding the barbarian
            resistance. As she divulged this intelligence, a wave of revulsion washed over her. She screamed in agony
            as
            her silky skin hardened to scales, her lustrous hair thickened to leather, and her manicured fingernails
            sharpened to claws. Dazed, she fell upon a group of horrified servants, rending them limb from limb in a
            heartbeat. When it was over the blood-soaked figure was no longer the ravishing jewel of the Noxian court,
            but a horror trapped somewhere between woman and serpent. Unable to serve in her traditional capacity,
            Cassiopeia departed for the League, continuing her service to Noxus on the Fields of Justice.\n\n

        <item>There is a place between dimensions, between worlds. To some it is known as the Outside, to others it is
            the Unknown. To those that truly know, however, it is called the Void. Despite its name, the Void is not an
            empty place, but rather the home of unspeakable things - horrors not meant for minds of men. Cho\'Gath is a
            creature born of the Void, a thing whose true nature is so awful most will not speak its name. Its fellows
            have been poking at the walls that divide dimensions for a crack, a way into Runeterra,
            where they can visit
            their own personal paradise of horror upon the world. They are called the Voidborn,
            creatures so ancient and
            terrible that they have been removed from history altogether. It is rumored that the Voidborn command vast
            armies of unspeakable creatures on other worlds, that they were once driven from Runeterra by powerful
            magic
            lost to antiquity.\n\n

            If such tales are true, then the rumors that follow must be equally true - that one day, the Voidborn will
            return. Even now, something dark stirs in Icathia, perverting the summoning rituals of the League to allow
            the presence of Cho\'Gath. It is an alien creature of malice and violence, a thing that causes all but the
            most stalwart to cringe in fear. Cho\'Gath even appears to feed on its predations, growing and swelling as
            it gorges itself. Worse yet, the creature is intelligent, perhaps greatly so, making most wonder how such a
            monster could be contained. Fortunately, the power of the League\'s summoning has confined Cho\'Gath\'s
            presence exclusively to the League of Legends. It is here that summoners use Cho\'Gath\'s Voidborn
            abilities
            to help decide the fate of Runeterra. The Terror of the Void knows what fate it would choose for Runeterra,
            given half the chance.\n\n

        <item>When Heimerdinger and his yordle colleagues migrated to Piltover, they embraced science as a way of life,
            and they immediately made several groundbreaking contributions to the techmaturgical community. What
            yordles
            lack in stature, they make up for with industriousness. Corki, the Daring Bombardier, gained his title by
            test-piloting one of these contributions - the original design for the Reconnaissance Operations Front-Line
            Copter, an aerial assault vehicle which has become the backbone of the Bandle City Expeditionary Force
            (BCEF). Together with his squadron - the Screaming Yipsnakes - Corki soars over Valoran, surveying the
            landscape and conducting aerial acrobatics for the benefit of onlookers below.\n\n

            Corki is the most renowned of the Screaming Yipsnakes for remaining cool under fire and exhibiting bravery
            to the point of madness. Before the League, he served several tours of duty,
            often volunteering for missions
            that would take him behind enemy lines, either gathering intelligence or delivering messages through hot
            zones. He thrived on danger, and enjoyed nothing more than a good dogfight in the morning. More than just
            an
            ace pilot, Corki also made several modifications to his copter, outfitting it with an arsenal of weapons
            which some speculate were more for show than functionality. When open hostilities ceased as part of the
            agreement surrounding the formation of the League, Corki was forced into a retirement, which he felt \'cut
            the engines and clipped the wings\'. He tried to make do with stunt flying and canyon running, but it was
            never the same without the refreshing smell of gunpowder streaking through the air around him. When
            Heimerdinger joined the League of Legends, it was no surprise to see Corki follow soon after, eager to test
            his mettle against the best the world has to offer.\n\n

        <item>It is said that the man now known as Dr. Mundo was born without any sort of conscience. Instead,
            he had an
            unquenchable desire to inflict pain through experimentation. By the time he was five, most of the pets in
            the Zaun neighborhood where Mundo grew up had gone missing. By his teenage years, his parents were nowhere
            to be found. By the time he had legally acquired his license to practice medicine, he had been acquitted of
            thirty-eight separate charges of murder by the Zaun authorities; the lack of evidence made prosecution
            impossible.\n\n

            Dr. Mundo has become equal parts serial killer and mad scientist, though no one is entirely sure how his
            butchery qualifies as science. However, he has made tremendous strides in mapping the pain response in the
            human brain and body, going so far as being able to suppress it, even in the most excruciating of
            circumstances. He has also tapped into the primal parts of the brain through chemistry, learning how to
            enhance aggression and adrenaline, as well as dulling conscience and the survival instinct. In short, Dr.
            Mundo\'s life\'s work has been how to create the perfect science-enhanced killer. Unfortunately, the
            city-state of Noxus regards such behavior as a sign of initiative and ambition, rather than inhumanity.
            Originally fighting for Zaun, Dr. Mundo was recruited to also fight for Noxus in the League of Legends; the
            Madman dual faction status represents the fruits of a blossoming relationship between Zaun and Noxus. He
            continues his experiments to this day, even using himself as an experimental subject, as evidenced by his
            disfigured appearance and his... unique manner of speaking. There are rumors that the High Command in Noxus
            has given him free reign to pursue his life\'s work in his spare time.\n\n

        <item>Evelynn\'s origins are shrouded in mystery - a mystery she herself helps to perpetuate. What everyone
            does
            know about Evelynn, however, is that she is one of the most skilled assassins in Valoran. It is clear upon
            first meeting her that she is not quite human. Some theorize that she was cursed with a mild form of
            fantastical vampirism as a child. Supporters of this theory contend that her ability to sap the very life
            essence of her opponents on (and off) the Fields of Justice, while still being able to tolerate direct
            sunlight, would account for this belief. There is some evidence that Evelynn originally came from the
            Shadow
            Isles - the mysterious island located northwest of Valoran that is eternally blanketed by a thick,
            unnatural
            fog. It is thought that the Shadow Isles are home to countless forms of undead,
            though no one seems eager to
            perform the exploration necessary to find out the truth. Evelynn neither confirms nor denies her connection
            to Shadow Isles.\n\n

            The power brokers of Valoran know that Evelynn\'s services come at the highest of premiums, and her recent
            addition to the League of Legends indicates that her ambitions are growing. Her savagery on the Fields of
            Justice has been so great that new rumors about her origins are now circulating. The most popular one - an

            always

        <item>Ezreal was born with the gift of magic flowing through his veins. Ezreal, however, was also born with a
            much stronger sense of wanderlust. Put into school to become a skilled techmaturgist, Ezreal quickly became
            bored with magical studies. By the time the boy genius was eight years old, he had fully mapped out the
            underground tunnels of Piltover. The quality of his work was so great that the government of Piltover
            purchased his maps and salaried his services as Piltover\'s Grandmaster Explorer. This sealed the deal on
            Ezreal\'s path in life - he would eschew the arcane arts in favor of archaeology. Since then, countless of
            Ezreal\'s adventures have been written about as romanticized stories.\n\n

            One of Ezreal\'s latest adventures, however, has brought him face-to-face with his other legacy - his
            latent
            magical power. While exploring the pyramids of Shurima Desert, Ezreal uncovered an amulet of incredible
            power. Aside from the sheer size of the amulet (it was made for a being easily twice Ezreal\'s size), it
            allows the wielder to control and shape magical energy - provided a source of magic is in the vicinity.
            This
            allowed Ezreal to tap into his natural talent for magic without having to put any serious effort into it
            - a
            big win for the Prodigal Explorer. The drawback is that for some unknown reason, the amulet is attuned with
            summoning magic. Without warning, Ezreal may find himself acting as a champion for, as he puts it, \'a
            summoner hell-bent on resolving some irrelevant world-shattering League conflict.\' Still, Ezreal feels
            being summoned into a Field of Justice on occasion is a small price to pay.\n\n

            \'There\'s little time to study musty tomes when you\'re busy crawling around where the musty tomes
            originally
            came from.\' Such is Ezreal\'s credo.

        <item>For nearly twenty years, Fiddlesticks has stood alone in the easternmost summoning chamber of the
            Institute of War. Only the burning emerald light of his unearthly gaze pierces the musty darkness of his
            dust-covered home. It is here that the Harbinger of Doom keeps a silent vigil. His is a cautionary tale of
            power run amok, taught to all summoners within the League. Decades ago, there existed a powerful rune mage
            from Zaun - Istvaan. At the end of the fifth Rune War, he became one of the League\'s first summoners. Too
            much a prisoner to the old ways of magic, Istvaan stepped further and further outside the rules of conduct
            in the League. In what was ultimately his last match, his reach finally exceeded his grasp. Sealing himself
            inside the easternmost summoning chamber, he began incanting the most forbidden of rituals - an
            extra-planar
            summoning.\n\n

            What exactly happened inside that chamber remains unknown. No champion came to represent Zaun that day in
            Summoner\'s Rift. Only silence echoed back from repeated knocks on the chamber door. The first apprentice
            who entered was cut down immediately by an unearthly scythe. What few who followed and survived were driven
            mad by fear, mere husks of men gibbering about crows and death. Afraid of the evil even Istvaan could not
            control, the League sealed all exits to the chamber, hoping they could contain what they could not destroy.
            Years went by, but the wooden figure within never moved save to slay any foolish enough to enter. Seeing no
            recourse to reclaim the chamber, the Council instead devised a use for Fiddlesticks: executioner. While he
            comes to life and seemingly abides by the rules of summoning in the Fields of Justice,
            what he awaits inside
            his chamber is unknown. His unmoving face yields no clues, and his scythe stands ready to strike down any
            who stand before him.\n\n

        <item>Centuries ago, an ancient water-dwelling race built a hidden city beneath a mountain in the sea. Though
            these creatures had their enemies, the city was an impenetrable fortress, and, in the safety it provided,
            they grew complacent. Fizz, however, harbored a curious spirit that could not be satisfied living so
            cushioned a life. Unable to resist the allure of danger, Fizz had a habit of sneaking out of the city to
            look for trouble. In his many adventures he grew to be a powerful fighter with a keen resourcefulness that
            let him skirt danger with clever ease. One day, Fizz returned to find the city abandoned: his people had
            vanished, leaving Fizz without a clue to explain their disappearance. With nothing left in the city to keep
            him, Fizz salvaged an enchanted trident from the ruins and set out alone.\n\n

            For years, Fizz wandered the ocean, using the skills he\'d learned during his adventures as a young boy to
            survive. Finally, Fizz discovered the port of Bilgewater. He was fascinated with the existence of life
            above
            the water and could not resist exploring the island. In his endless curiosity, Fizz inadverently meddled in
            the affairs of the humans who lived there and his presence did not go unnoticed. His mischief angered many
            residents who eventually sought to capture or kill him. Fizz found himself cornered, and he prepared to
            return to the sea despite the fondness he\'d come to hold for Bilgewater. As he stood at the docks, a
            massive dragon-shark attacked the port. Fizz defeated the beast, using his resourcefulness and knowledge of
            the creatures\' weaknesses to his advantage. Having earned the gratitude and respect of the humans, Fizz
            decided to stay in Bilgewater. He joined the League of Legends to further serve his new home.\n\n

        <item>Long before the League\'s regulation of such magic, mages experimented with the creation of artificial
            life. Now forbidden, instilling golems with reason was once not so uncommon a practice amongst the more
            expert of craftsmen. One such visionary was the Demacian artificer, Durand. Peerless at crafting sentient
            beings, Durand\'s constructs served as tireless guardians for the border towns of his beloved city-state,
            affording them protection from their Noxian neighbors. For his own defense, however, Durand kept his magnum
            opus: Galio. This mighty construct - forged in the image of a gargoyle - kept him safe on his journeys,
            allowing him to perform his important work without fear of reprisal from those hostile to his homeland.
            That
            is, until dealing with his taxing sentinels finally roused the ire of the Noxian High Command.\n\n

            As Durand crossed the Howling Marsh with his masterwork in tow, he was set upon by Noxian assassins in
            force. Outnumbered and overwhelmed, Galio looked on in horror as the murderers cut down his charge,
            executing him swiftly before vanishing back into the mists. Stripped of his reason for being, Galio
            despaired. For years he remained in solitude, standing vigil over the bones of the master he had failed to
            protect... a literal monument to his own everlasting shame. Then, one nondescript day, a sad but determined
            yordle girl carrying a mighty Demacian crown stopped in the shadow of a great statue to rest. Hidden in
            plain sight from his unsuspecting visitor, Galio studied the forlorn yordle. She looked as though she too
            shouldered a tremendous burden. As quietly and as stoically as she had arrived, she departed in the
            direction of Demacia. This encounter lit a spark in Galio\'s eye. Remembering the cause that his master had
            died defending, Galio arose from his silent purgatory and followed in the wake of this brave creature. He
            had a new reason to live: to join the League of Legends and fight for the will of Demacia.\n\n

        <item>Gangplank was born the son of the dread pirate captain Vincent the Shadow - one of the most wealthy and
            feared pirates in all of Blue Flame Island. One might think this would have spoiled the boy with a
            cushioned
            life of privilege, but the truth is quite the opposite. Growing up in the city of Bilgewater isn\'t easy;
            pirates are not known for their compassion, and that most certainly extends to their families. Vincent
            wanted his son to grow up tough and strong, so he was extremely hard on the young Gangplank. Even as a
            child, Gangplank was as mean as a snake and is said to have slept with his eyes open. As he grew, the young
            man rapidly became the most ruthless and feared pirate in all of Bilgewater, and his daddy was never more
            proud than on the day of his son\'s eighteenth birthday - when Gangplank stabbed his old man in the back
            and
            claimed the famed pirate ship, the Dead Pool, for his own.\n\n

            The continent of Valoran, however, is a dangerous place for pirates; Gangplank could read the writing on
            the
            wall. The den of pirates known as Bilgewater would soon be pulled down by the undertow of Valoranian
            politics and the Institute of War. It was time for Bilgewater to have their own champion to represent them
            in the League of Legends, and who better than the fiercest pirate of them all? It is said that Gangplank
            has
            enough power and favor to claim the title of the Pirate King back home, but that he is simply biding his
            time and building his reputation as a champion before he returns to a life of piracy.\n\n

        <item>Throughout Valoran, the resolve of Demacia\'s military is alternately celebrated or despised, but always
            respected. Their \'zero tolerance\' moral code is strictly upheld by civilians and soldiers alike. In
            combat, this means Demacian troops may not make excuses, flee, or surrender under any circumstance. These
            principles are espoused to their forces by unrivaled demagogues who lead by example. Garen, the valiant
            warrior who bears the title \'the Might of Demacia\', is the paradigm to which these leaders are compared.
            Thousands of great heroes have risen and fallen on the bloody battlefields between Demacia and its
            preeminent rival, Noxus. It was beneath their mighty banners of war that Garen first met steel with
            Katarina, the Sinister Blade. The infantrymen who beheld this event (and survived) commented that it seemed
            as though the two were locked in a mortal waltz against a symphony of clashing blades.\n\n

            Garen, the pride of the Demacian military and leader of the Dauntless Vanguard, returned from this battle
            breathless for the first time in his career, though some speculate that this was due to reasons other than
            exhaustion. The plausibility of these rumors was bolstered when, in every instance thereafter, Garen seized
            the opportunity to encounter the Sinister Blade again. A paragon of Demacian ethic, Garen never entertained
            such allegations, for he knew others couldn\'t understand. Even simply the pursuit of a worthy opponent on
            the battlefield is, to a true warrior, the reason to rise each morning. The promise of one, particularly so
            beautifully and diametrically opposed, is the validation of his existence.\n\n

        <item>The foothills of the Great Barrier are home to the hardiest people found anywhere on Valoran. Only those
            with great fortitude and endurance dwell in what is perhaps the most rugged and unforgiving environment
            anywhere on the face of Runeterra. It is here that the mighty Gragas keeps permanent residence,
            living south
            of Noxus. This behemoth of a man has long eschewed the rigors of civilization for what he calls his \'slice
            of paradise;\' he has no neighbors to bother him and plenty of space to pursue his life\'s ambition -
            brewing. Grogs, ales, meads, and wine - nothing is beyond his skill to brew. What makes Gragas a truly
            special brewmaster, however, is his proximity to a large and powerful nexus.\n\n

            The magic of this nexus has seeped into his fermented creations, and Gragas has consumed enough of his own
            poison over the years to slake the thirst of an army. This arcane alcohol has caused Gragas to swell both
            in
            height and girth; he looms over the tallest of men and boasts nearly twice their width. To complement his
            immoderate size, Gragas has developed an ornery temper - one fueled by liquor and raw magic. His infrequent
            sojourns into Noxus for supplies always unfold the same way: Gragas enters a Noxian tavern,
            Gragas gets into
            several fights, Gragas lays out countless citizens, and finally Gragas flees for the foothills with Noxian
            constables in hot - though reluctant - pursuit. His misadventures have garnered him the attention of
            several
            summoners in the League of Legends, and he is now a willing champion in the arenas...doling out hard liquor
            and harder fists.\n\n

        <item>Malcolm Graves was born in the back of a Bilgewater tavern and left there with a bottle of spiked milk.
            He
            survived a childhood in the pirate-run slums using every dirty trick in the book. Intent on building a new
            life for himself, he stowed away on the first ship to the mainland he could sneak aboard. However, the grim
            realities of the world forced him to eke out an unsavory living in the underground of various city-states,
            jumping the border whenever things got too hot. At a particularly high-stakes game of cards, he found
            himself seated opposite Twisted Fate. They both flipped four aces on the final hand. It was the first time
            either conman had met his equal. The two formed an alliance, swindling marks at the tables and scrapping
            back-to-back in the alleys afterward. Together, they ran the streets – stacking chips, decks, and charges.

            Unfortunately Graves made the mistake of hustling a hefty sum from Dr. Aregor Priggs,
            a high-ranking Zaunite
            official and businessman. When Priggs discovered how he\'d been played, he became obsessed with revenge. He
            learned about Twisted Fate\'s all-consuming desire to control magic and he promptly offered him a trade:
            serve Graves up in exchange for enrollment in a procedure which would grant his wish. Twisted Fate took the
            deal – both he and Graves knew the stakes of their arrangement, but the offer was too good. Once acquired,
            Priggs had Graves taken to a special location built to hold men whose crimes – or more precisely their
            punishments – were meant to stay off the books. Graves endured years of captivity at the hands of Zaun\'s
            most unscrupulous wardens before he managed to escape. One of his fellow detainees introduced him to an
            eccentric gunsmith who modified a shotgun exactly to his specifications. After he paid a visit to Priggs,
            Graves joined the League of Legends with two targets in his sights: Twisted Fate and payback.

        <item>It is unusual to see yordles outside of Bandle City, but the lure of science was something Heimerdinger

            all
            yordle scientists and there was little his home could still offer him. The great academies of Piltover far
            to the north called to him, daring him to make his mark in the City of Progress. Knowing he would never
            thrive away from his own kind, Heimerdinger gathered like-minded yordles to join him in his quest, thus
            forming the backbone of the now famous Yordle Academy of Science and Progress. Since then,
            he has become one
            of the most respected minds of the modern age and his academy is one of the leading institutions in all of

            Heimerdinger has pioneered many new scientific achievements, delving deeper and deeper into the field of

            simultaneously. It most certainly worked, but at an unusual cost - Heimerdinger\'s brain increased in size.
            His head changed along with it and now the great scientist looks like a yordle with a giant brain-shaped
            head. Heimerdinger has turned his attentions to the current state of war on Valoran, however, and works to
            rectify what he considers is an unacceptable situation. Heimerdinger believes that science is the key to
            saving the world. Much more, he has rolled up his sleeves and is out to prove this as a member of the

        <item>The Ionians have developed some of the most breathtaking and deadly martial arts on all of Runeterra -
            just one manifestation of their pursuit of enlightenment. The most remarkable blade style to emerge,
            however, was the unusual byproduct of foreign intervention. Master Lito was a swordsman whose teachings
            were
            sought by ruling classes from nearly every city-state. His art was a highly-guarded secret, but it was said
            that swords would breathe in his grasp. He withered unexpectedly from a mysterious disease which baffled
            the
            brightest of Runeterran physicians. When he died, he left behind Zelos and Irelia, his son and daughter,
            and
            a truly unique weapon. Zelos became a sergeant in the Ionian military and left to seek assistance from
            Demacia immediately prior to Noxus\' invasion of Ionia. Irelia, charged with the protection of their home
            until Zelos returned, was alone when the Noxian forces struck.\n\n

            The Ionians fought admirably, but soon Ionian blood stained the land beneath the prints of foreign boots.
            At
            the Great Stand of the Placidium, Ionians prepared for surrender, but were inspired to maintain their
            resistance when the young Irelia lifted her father\'s enormous blade and pledged to hold until her brother
            returned. In the chaos of the ensuing fight, Irelia was cursed with dark Noxian Necromancy. As her life
            ebbed, Soraka, the Starchild, made a final attempt to anchor her fading soul. Unwilling to relinquish her
            home, Irelia rose at the brink of death, and her father\'s sword lifted in the air alongside her. Irelia
            rushed back to the fore, unfazed by the blade\'s sudden animation. The weapon danced around her
            effortlessly, cutting down Noxians as they gaped in horror. The decimated invaders were forced to retreat
            from the Placidium. Irelia was appointed Ionia\'s Captain of the Guard,
            and when the defense of her homeland
            moved to the Fields of Justice, so did she.\n\n

            practice of magic. Such a sorceress is Janna, who first learned magic as an orphan growing up admist the
            chaos that is the city-state of Zaun. Janna eked out what living she could on the streets. Life was tough
            and dangerous for the beautiful young girl, and she survived by her wits,
            and by stealing when wits weren\'t
            enough. The rampant magic that characterizes Zaun was the first and most alluring tool which Janna realized
            could both protect and elevate her. Janna discovered that she had an affinity for a particular type of
            magic
            - the elemental magic of air. She mastered her studies of air magic in a matter of months, almost as if she
            was born of it. Janna went from a street vagrant to an avatar of the air virtually overnight, stunning and
            surpassing those who taught her. Such a rapid ascension also changed her physical appearance, giving her an

            the Dauntless Vanguard, an elite Demacian strike force led by Jarvan\'s childhood companion, Garen.\n\n

            Those close to him believed that his capture changed him. Xin Zhao was quoted as saying: \'His eyes never
            seemed to look at you, only through you to something he could not look away from.\' One day, without
            warning, Jarvan IV handpicked a squad of Demacian soldiers and left Demacia, vowing to find \'atonement\'.
            He began by tracking and hunting the most dangerous beasts and bandits he could find in northern Valoran,
            but he soon tired of such prey. Seeking something that only he understood, he ventured south of the Great
            Barrier. He wasn\'t heard from again for nearly two years. After many had assumed the worst, he returned to
            glorious fanfare on the streets of Demacia. His Demacian plates were adorned with the bones and scales of
            creatures unknown. His eyes bore the wisdom of someone twice his age. Of the twelve soldiers who had
            departed with him, only two returned. In a tone as cold and steady as steel, he swore to bring the enemies
            of Demacia to their knees.\n\n

        <item>It is seldom the case where a champion is defined by his actions after joining the League of Legends
            rather than before. Such is the case with Jax, for whom the argument could be made that he is the most
            prolific tournament fighter currently at the Institute of War. Before joining the League, Jax was an
            unremarkable soldier-for-hire. For reasons known only to the former leader of the League, High Councilor
            Reginald Ashram, Jax was put on the top of the list of candidates to receive a League Judgment - the
            interview process that either accepts or rejects a prospective champion. His Judgment was the quickest in
            League history, where the Doors of Acceptance glowed and slowly swung open as soon as it began. Jax faced
            no
            recorded Observation or Reflection during his Judgment.\n\n

            Jax proved himself to be an immediate terror in the Fields of Justice. The self-proclaimed \'Armsmaster of
            the League\' rattled off a streak of consecutive wins that to this day has not been matched. A number of
            summoners in the League grew concerned that the perceived objectivity of the League of Legends would be
            questioned by the presence of an unknown fighter who was unbeatable. For this reason, the new leader of the
            League (following Reginald Ashram\'s disappearance), High Councilor Heyward Relivash, created special
            restrictions for Jax to fight under. This was something the League had never done before,
            and something that
            has never been done since. The burly fighter responded by imposing his own special conditions; as a means
            of
            protest, he permitted himself to fight using only a brass lamppost. Neither the League\'s sanctions nor his
            own has affected his winning ways. The League has since rescinded its sanctions, but Jax has not; he fights
            and fights well with his trusty brass lamppost.\n\n

        <item>Even in her youth, Karma exhibited almost superhuman composure. While her peers explored the torrent of
            emotions that came with adolescence, Karma meditated in the Lotus Gardens. She was convinced that the true
            path to enlightenment was a journey inward, to a place within the self, overlooked by most. She exuded such
            inner contentment that she quickly became a go-to mediator and confidante in her village. Her instructors
            used to say: \'That girl can not only weather a storm, but calm it.\' Karma did not live extravagantly; her
            parents owned a local business selling antiques in the Navori province and they often struggled to provide
            for themselves, though they did so with cheery optimism. Her most prized possessions were two exquisite
            fans
            taken from her family\'s shop.\n\n

            When Noxian troops invaded southern Ionia, her village was one of the first to fall. The villages who
            survived the assault were captured by Noxian forces. It was then that Karma found her calling. By
            exploiting
            the insecurities of the Noxian commander, she negotiated the safe release of the villages to the northern
            lands. She was present at the Placidium, where the Elders had considered surrender until Irelia\'s
            impassioned last stand renewed the Ionian\'s hope. Karma used this hope to solidify the Elders\' commitment
            to remain defiant against the Noxian onslaught. For her devotion and charisma,
            Karma was made the figurehead
            of the Ionian resistance. She never compromised, and she shared every hardship with her people,
            even when it
            came to combat. By tapping into her inner resilience, she discovered that she could bring great force to
            bear against her foes on the battlefield. She modified her fans into lethal implements, and was tutored by
            Janna to enhance their effects. The Noxians called her, \'The Enlightened One,\' a nickname she embraced,
            and one which they would come to dread. She joined the League to represent Ionia in the ultimate political
            arena.\n\n

        <item>The vast quantities of physical magic that were consumed and destroyed during Valoran\'s numerous Rune
            Wars have scarred much of Valoran. Many locations far from civilization have been morphed into hazardous
            and
            dangerous locales. The Howling Marsh is one of these places, and the self-appointed overlord of this land
            is
            the lich known as Karthus. It is thought that Karthus was a mage who, in life, was foolish enough to enter
            the fetid waters seeking his fortune, and that he was forever transformed by whatever dark magic permeates
            the swamp. Karthus now rules over his swampy dominion with an iron (albeit skeletal) fist. Visitors are not
            welcome, and those who are not scared away by the lich\'s terrible power most likely end up as one of the
            undead themselves... skeletons and zombies in Karthus\' growing army of eternal servants. On the darkest of
            nights, Karthus is said to sing the tales of those who have succumbed to the swamp, past and present.\n\n

            Karthus\' tenure in the League of Legends is one of the more unusual ones in the history of the League.
            First, it is highly unusual that a lich who was known for isolation and hatred of life would even be a
            willing part of an organization which promoted the preservation of life. Next, Karthus specifically eschews
            the accrual of power and influence gained through service to the League; he is essentially an unpaid
            volunteer. This behavior is completely different than what his life outside of the League would have
            onlookers believe. Karthus has never spoken about his intentions in being a champion of the League, and in
            fact becomes quite agitated when asked about it. In the interests of not aggravating a lich, most sensible
            people subsequently drop the issue.\n\n

        <item>There is a place between dimensions and between worlds. To some it is known as the Outside, to others it
            is the Unknown. To most, however, it is called the Void. Despite its name, the Void is not an empty place,
            but rather the home of unspeakable things, horrors not meant for minds of men. Though such knowledge is
            lost
            in modern times, there are those who have unwittingly discovered what lies beyond,
            and they have been unable
            to turn away. Kassadin is such a creature. He was once a man forced to look upon the face of the Void and
            forever changed by what he saw. Once a seeker of forbidden knowledge, he discovered that what he sought was
            something else entirely. He is one of the few that has found his way to forgotten Icathia and lived to tell
            the tale, following the scant breadcrumbs hidden in ancient texts.\n\n

            Within a decaying cyclopean city, Kassadin found secrets of the kind that he will never share - secrets
            that
            made him quake with fear at the visions of things to come that were thrust upon him. The power of the place
            threatened to consume him forever, but Kassadin took the only route available to him in order to survive -
            he let the Void inside him. Miraculously, he was able to overcome the alien urges that went with it, and he
            emerged as something more than human. Though a part of him died that day, he knows that he must protect
            Valoran from the things scratching at the door, waiting to get in and visit their torments upon the world.
            They are only one step away... something to which the appearance of the abomination known as Cho\'Gath
            attests.\n\n

            If you look upon the Void, you can\'t put it behind you. If you look upon Kassadin, he is probably already
            there.

        <item>As a militaristic state, it would perhaps come as no surprise that the primary responsibilities of Noxian
            women are raising strong children and providing succor for husbands who walk the path of soldiery. There
            are
            some, however, for whom nurture is not nature, and Katarina is just such a creature. Born the daughter of
            the feared Noxian General Du Couteau, the girl was always more interested in her father\'s knives than in
            the dresses, jewelry, and other trifles that her sisters spent so much time fussing over. A childhood
            dispute soon unveiled her uncanny knack for bloodshed, and her father, ever the opportunist, happily
            fostered her killer instincts. After training under the tutelage of the finest assassins the mighty
            city-state had to offer, Katarina first cut her teeth performing assassinations in the Ionian War. There,
            her ruthless mastery of the knife and dagger combined with her sadistic temperament to earn her the title
            Sinister Blade, a moniker that would follow her for the remainder of her career. She is most famous,
            however, for her exploits in the campaigns against Demacia, especially those surrounding her engagements
            with the nation\'s champion, Garen; a rivalry that began when she recovered the remains of Sion from a
            vanguard under his protection.\n\n

            With the demand for warfare somewhat arrested by the tenuous peace settling over Valoran, Katarina sought
            the allure of violence in its last remaining haven: The League of Legends. Some might say it was an
            inevitability that Katarina\'s chosen path would draw her to become a champion of the League, continuing to
            enforce the will of Noxus and bring prestige of war to her noble family. There,
            she continues to perform her

        <item>In a world far away where an ancient war still rages, Kayle was a great hero - the strongest of an
            immortal race committed to destroying evil wherever it could be found. For ten thousand years, Kayle fought
            tirelessly for her people, wielding her flaming sword forged before time itself. She shielded her delicate
            features beneath her enchanted armor, the sole remaining masterpiece of an extinct race of craftsmen.
            Though
            a beautiful, striking creature, Kayle, now as then, avoids showing her face; war has taken a terrible toll
            upon her spirit. In her quest for victory, she sometimes would try to lift the wicked up from their morass
            of evil, but more than often she instead purged those she herself deemed beyond redemption. To Kayle,
            justice can so often be an ugly thing.\n\n

            Ten years ago, Kayle\'s war against evil was nearly won... until her rebellious sister Morgana, a pariah
            amongst their people, suddenly gained powerful new allies: magicians of a hitherto unknown world called
            Runeterra. Morgana traded servitude to a number of the summoners in Runeterra\'s League of Legends for
            powerful new abilities that, if mastered, threatened to bring Kayle and her people to their knees. To save
            her world, Kayle had no choice but to make a pact with the League herself. She approached the leader of the
            League, High Counselor Reginald Ashram, with a deal of her own. In exchange for a thousand years of
            Kayle\'s
            service, Ashram halted all League interference on Kayle\'s world. With Ashram\'s disappearance five years
            ago, Kayle has new causes on Valoran: find out who or what caused Ashram to disappear, defeat her sister
            Morgana upon the Fields of Justice, and bring her own brand of justice to the League of Legends.\n\n

        <item>There exists an ancient order originating in the Ionian Isles dedicated to the preservation of balance.
            Order, chaos, light, darkness -- all things must exist in perfect harmony for such is the way of the
            universe. This order is known as the Kinkou and it employs a triumvirate of shadow warriors to uphold its
            causes in the world. Kennen is one of these shadow warriors, entrusted with the sacred duty of Coursing the
            Sun - tirelessly conveying the justice of the Kinkou.\n\n

            Kennen was born in Bandle City and it was said that in his first living moments he bolted first from the
            womb and second from the midwife who delivered him. His parents had thought that he would outgrow his
            boundless energy, but as he matured his energy found no limits and was matched only by his unnerving speed.
            Despite his astonishing gifts, he remained unnoticed (or at least uncaught, as he was quite the prankster)
            until, on a dare, he ran straight up the great outer wall of the Placidium. When word of this feat reached
            Kinkou ears, Kennen was quickly and quietly brought in for an audience. He found that the role of the Heart
            of the Tempest suited him, frenetically delivering both the word and the punishments of the Kinkou across
            the realm. He now works with his fellows Akali and Shen to enforce the balance of Valoran. This hallowed
            pursuit has unsurprisingly led the triumvirate to the Fields of Justice.\n\n

            anchored itself to his psyche. From within, this voice bestowed upon him terrible purpose, and though
            Malzahar was no longer tormented by its call, the voice did not cease its unrelenting summons. This baleful
            beacon\'s gentle flicker -- now fastened to Runeterra -- drew forth a putrid beast that ambled across a
            threshold it did not understand, widening a fissure between the spaces which were never meant to meet.
            There
            amongst the haunting ruins of Icathia, Kog\'Maw manifested in Valoran with unsettling curiosity. The spark
            which led him to Runeterra teased him still, urging him gently towards Malzahar. It also encouraged him to
            familiarize himself with his new environment, to the stark horror of everything he encountered on his
            journey.\n\n

            The enchanting colors and aromas of Runeterra intoxicated Kog\'Maw, and he explored the fruits of the
            strange world the only way he knew how: by devouring them. At first he sampled only the wild flora and
            fauna
            he happened across. As he traversed the parched Tempest Flats, however, he came upon a tribe of nomads.
            Seemingly unhampered by conventional rules of physics, Kog\'Maw consumed every nomad and any obstacles they
            put in his way, amounting to many times his own mass and volume. The most composed of his victims may have
            had time to wonder if this was due to the caustic enzymes which stung the ground as they dripped from his
            gaping mouth, although such musings were abruptly concluded. When his wake of catastrophe reached the
            Institute of War, an enthusiastic Malzahar greeted him with an enticing prospect: taste the best Runeterra

        <item>Every city has its dark side, even one whose reputation is already of a questionable hue. Noxus - though
            its name is already invoked with a mixture of reverence and revulsion - is no exception to this simple
            truth. Deep within the winding dungeons that honeycomb the earth beneath its dark, meandering streets lies
            the real underbelly of this sprawling metropolis, a haven for all manner of malevolence. Amongst the cults,
            covens, and secret societies that call this labyrinth their home, LeBlanc, the Deceiver, presides over the
            Black Rose, a remnant from a lost, yet similarly unscrupulous time in Noxian history. Ruthless and
            seemingly
            ageless, LeBlanc and her ilk were a mainstay in Noxian political affairs during the era before the
            militarization of the Noxian government. In those days, this guild of powerful magicians met in secret to
            further their hidden agenda, and to hone a craft more subtle than that preferred by those currently in
            power.\n\n

            While their exact motives have always remained mysterious, it was widely believed that the Black Rose was
            the true power behind the throne while the aristocracy still reigned in Noxus. When raw martial prowess
            became the ultimate determination of whose will held sway in the Empire, the Black Rose seemed to vanish
            overnight. Many believed that perhaps their time had simply passed, and that its members had put aside
            their
            quests for social and political dominance. When LeBlanc reemerged at the gates of the Institute of War,
            however, it became clear that these masters of shadow and flame had simply been bidding their time, waiting
            for a new global authority to emerge: the League of Legends.\n\n

            of his peers, and his skill drew the attention of Reginald Ashram, the League\'s High Councilor at the
            time.
            While studying at the Arcanum Majoris, Lee Sin became frustrated with instruction paced for the other
            students. He spent his free time researching the nuances of summoning in hopes of graduating sooner. He
            made
            amazing advances in his arcane studies, surpassing all other students. By all indications, he would have
            become one of the League\'s greatest summoners were it not for one terrible mistake. Too impatient, he
            attempted to test his ability by summoning a beast from the Plague Jungles. What he summoned instead was a
            young boy, but not in one piece. He barely had time to look the boy in what was once his face before the
            jumbled human mass fell lifeless to the floor. A League investigation later revealed that the boy\'s entire
            village was obliterated by feedback from the ritual.\n\n

            Lee Sin\'s talents were so promising that the League was willing to overlook the incident, but he could
            never forgive himself. He left the Institute and journeyed to the Shojin Monastery for eternal repentance,
            swearing never to practice magic again. Years later, hoping to atone for his crime with martyrdom, he set
            himself ablaze as a protest of the Noxian occupation of Ionia. He remained alive in this state, enduring
            searing agony for weeks. His actions paved the way for a League match wherein Ionia prevailed, but by the
            time he was doused, his eyes had been burned completely from their sockets. Hailed as a savior, he was
            reborn, and his will to act invigorated. He joined the League of Legends to continue his atonement with
            sweat and blood, a true monk\'s only possessions.\n\n

        <item>On the upper slopes of Mount Targon, the warriors of Rakkor live and breathe only for war. However,
            Targon\'s peak is reserved for a special group of Rakkoran who answer to a \'higher\' calling. Members of
            this group, called the Solari, retire their mantles of war, choosing instead to devote their lives to
            reverence of the sun. According to legend, the Solari were formed by a warrior who could call the raw might
            of the sun down upon his enemies in combat. He claimed Mount Targon\'s summit, the point on Valoran closest
            to the sun, for his solar devotion, a tradition which generations of Solari have preserved to this day.
            Though they maintain their reverence, no other warrior possessed the gifts of the founder -- until
            Leona.\n\n

            Leona\'s parents were traditional Rakkorans, both bred for the heat of battle. To them, Leona was a problem
            child. She was capable of fighting as fiercely as any other -- including her childhood friend, Pantheon --
            but she did not share their zeal for killing. She believed that the true worth of a soldier lay in her
            ability to defend and protect. When it came time for her Rite of Kor, a ceremony in which two Rakkoran
            teens
            battle to the death for the right to bear a relic-weapon, Leona refused to fight. For this, the Rakkoran
            leaders ordered her execution, but when they tried to strike the fatal blow, sunlight burst forth, bathing
            Mount Targon in light. As it faded, Leona stood unharmed and her executioners lay unconscious around her.
            The Solari immediately claimed Leona, demanding that her sentence be repealed. She donned the golden armor
            of the Solari and they bestowed upon her the sword and shield passed down from the ancient sun-warrior of
            legend. The Solari helped Leona focus her abilities, and when she was ready she left to join the League of
            Legends.\n\n

            that did not actually exist. She could also hide in plain sight. Somehow, she was able to reverse engineer
            arcane magical spells after seeing them cast only once. She was hailed as a prodigy, drawing the affections
            of the Demacian government, military, and citizens alike.\n\n

            As one of the youngest women to be tested by the College of Magic, she was discovered to possess a unique
            command over the powers of light. The young Lux viewed this as a great gift, something for her to embrace
            and use in the name of good. Realizing her unique skills, the Demacian military recruited and trained her
            in
            covert operations. She quickly became renowned for her daring achievements; the most dangerous of which
            found her deep in the chambers of the Noxian High Command. She extracted valuable inside information about
            the Noxus-Ionian conflict, earning her great favor with Demacians and Ionians alike. However,
            reconnaissance
            and surveillance was not for her. A light of her people, Lux\'s true calling was the League of Legends,
            where she could follow in her brother\'s footsteps and unleash her gifts as an inspiration for all of
            Demacia.\n\n

        <item>There is a world of perfect harmony, where all are part of the whole. The Monolith is the essence of all
            creation, and its denizens are but singular pieces of it. It is beautiful in its symmetry,
            and in its almost
            complete lack of uncertainty. The rocky beings that live there know their place and work to fulfill their
            duties to the fullest extent, functioning almost as a superorganism or hive. Malphite has always strived to
            live up to his full potential, as his own personal part of the whole, serving the role of a distinguished
            creature questing to enforce his people\'s flawless vision of order.\n\n

            One day, without warning, a dimensional rift opened, and he was summoned across the cosmos to the world of
            Runeterra. The transition was painful and terrifying for him, as he was cut off from the song of his people
            and the Monolith - things that had been ever-present in him since the day he was born. He raged, trapped in
            the Summoning Circle, as those who had called him made their plea. Runeterra was a world that had nearly
            been consumed by its disharmony. It was a world that needed champions to bring order out of chaos. It was
            to
            that end that the rock-creature was summoned, so that he could aid them in this quest. Looking past his own
            fear and apprehension, Malphite could see that this was a respectable goal, and one in which he could
            participate - perhaps uniquely so. Today, as part of the League of Legends, he hammers those who would seek
            to upset Valoran\'s movement toward order, especially turning his attention to those that wield chaotic
            magic. Unfortunately, Malphite has also begun to change, as he has been forced to face his own profound
            loneliness among the world\'s vibrant individuality.\n\n

        <item>Many men have gone mad beneath the glare of the Shurima sun, but it was during the night\'s chilling
            embrace that Malzahar relinquished his sanity. Malzahar was born a seer, blessed with the gift of prophecy.
            His talent, though unrefined, promised to be one of Runeterra\'s greatest boons, but destiny plotted him
            another course; his sensitivity to the roiling tides of fate allowed other, unwelcome things to tug at his
            subconscious mind. In his dreams, where the veil of separation is thinnest, a sinister thing beckoned. For
            some time, Malzahar was able to resist its prodding solicitation, but with each passing night the voice
            grew
            louder, or perhaps deeper, until he could withstand the call no more.\n\n

            He ventured into the desert without supplies, drawn by the lure of a specious charm. His destination: a
            lost
            civilization to the east, known to ancient texts as Icathia. Few believed such a place ever existed, and
            those who did were certain that the sands had long since devoured whatever remained. When Malzahar\'s
            cracked feet finally failed him, he found himself kneeling at the base of a bizarre crumbling obelisk.
            Beyond it lay the alien geometry of a ruined city and the giant decaying idols of dark and horrific gods.
            His eyes, seeing what others cannot, and what none should, were filled with the essence of the Void. His
            once shifting visions of the future were replaced with the immutable promise of Valoran beset by creatures
            of the Void. Standing alone, but not alone, amidst the echoing dunes, he noticed the familiar voice escape
            his own lips in a parched rasp, bearing three words whose weight trembled his knees. League of Legends. Now
            infused with the power of the void itself, Malzahar set off to the north to seek his fate.\n\n

        <item>The twisting magical energies unleashed by mages during the Rune Wars caused an incredible amount of
            devastation to the natural world. The League was established to control the use of this magic by confining
            it to the Fields of Justice. By limiting its use to there, they thought that they could prevent it from
            doing further harm to the environment. It seemed that they were successful until Maokai came into being.
            During a League match on The Twisted Treeline, Maokai, an ancient oak that stood above the upper jungle,
            spontaneously roared to life. Ripped from the natural balance by arcane forces, his sentience was forged in
            chaos. Before the Adjudicators of the League could step in and suppress him, he slew all six champions
            participating in the match. The scholars of the Arcanum Majoris took a keen interest in him, as they were
            eager to discover the secrets of his animation.\n\n

            Maokai was furious, however. He abhorred the existence was that thrust upon him; he felt it was a
            corruption
            of nature. He learned to communicate with people in hopes of finding a way to be returned to his former,
            true state. Seizing the opportunity, the League offered a trade. They would research a way to revert him so
            long as he agreed to fight in the League of Legends. Maokai was indifferent to verdicts rendered by the
            League, but he was eager to punish summoners for their wanton use of magic. He agreed to the terms under
            one
            condition: once they learned how to turn him back, they would never animate another tree again. He wears a
            lantern on the Fields of Justice to set him apart from the other trees,
            and as a warning to the animals that
            would do him harm.\n\n

        <item>Keeper of the ancient art of Wuju, Master Yi is a mystical warrior from the isle of Ionia. He descended
            from one of the few tribes dedicated to the preservation of Wuju, a martial art founded with the principles
            of absolute spiritual awareness of one\'s self and one\'s enemy. When the armies of Noxus invaded Ionia,
            Master Yi joined in the Ionian defense to fight the craven enemy, bringing his village honor through his
            unparalleled mastery of the blade. The ensuing battles ravaged the land, but no conflict inflicted as much
            horror as the day the armies of Noxus closed in on Yi\'s village. Left undefended, the village became the
            unfortunate test subject of the latest invention by an up-and-coming chemist, now known as Singed. The
            remains of the village that Master Yi returned to were so horrific that it remains a festering scar on
            Ionian history. To this day, no Ionian will ever publicly speak of what occurred.\n\n

            After the Noxian invasion was contained, Master Yi fell into a deep isolation. For years,
            he trained morning
            to night, speaking to no one and refusing offers of consolation by fellow Ionians. The only thing stopping
            him from madly charging into Noxus battle lines headfirst was his pledge to keep the Wuju style alive. Even
            though he seethed with impatience, his rage became a tool for sharpening his practice of Wuju, developing
            stronger and deadlier skills for his eventual vengeance. The only thing that roused him was news of the
            League\'s formation, and Noxus\' subsequent enrollment in the League. Master Yi now brings his mastery of
            the blade to the League of Legends with unflinching purpose: to avenge his kinfolk and end the predations
            of
            the Noxus once and for all.\n\n

        <item>For those who brave the harsh seas of Runeterra, attaining one\'s own ship and crew is the pinnacle of
            success. Sarah Fortune, a well-respected (some would say legendary) bounty hunter from Bilgewater, was able
            to achieve this feat just after her sixteenth birthday, etching out her name as the go-to gal for resolving
            special troubles. No bounty was too difficult or too dangerous for her feminine charm and her renowned use
            of her twin pistols, \'Shock and Awe\'. Her success gave her the means to legitimately purchase her own
            ship... with a little flirtatious haggling, of course. Things weren\'t always so fortunate for Miss
            Fortune,
            though. When she was young, trade ships began to dot the horizon of her quiet home in the northern shores
            of
            Blue Flame Island\'s largest chunk. Trade routes brought piracy, and the inhabitants soon found themselves
            caught in a frenzy of pillage.\n\n

            One day, young Sarah returned home to hear gunshots and screaming. Her front door was smashed open; inside,
            she saw her mother lying in a pool of blood. A sudden blow to her head made her collapse next to her slain
            mother. The last thing she could remember were her attacker\'s red eyes, as his face was blocked by a
            rogue\'s bandana. Miss Fortune has a strong distrust for pirates and she finds herself constantly bickering
            with the infamous Gangplank (the only captain to resist her charms) over the direction of Bilgewater
            politics. Her two goals: to unite the people of Bilgewater, making them into a strong and independent
            society, and to find the pirate who killed her mother. To that end, she has entered the League of Legends
            as
            a champion, trading her skills for the wealth and influence that will help her accomplish both.\n\n

        <item>During the most recent winter solstice - when no other night during the year is longer - a being like no
            other emerged from the forgotten alleyways of Noxus. Standing eight feet tall, and concealed within a
            razor-sharp armored shell, he came to be known only as Mordekaiser. The nature of what lies beneath his
            metallic carapace is a popular subject of speculation. Many allege that he is a mortal man with a heart
            that
            has hardened to iron. Others insist that he is a dark specimen of the undead. But there are some who
            whisper
            warnings that he is merely a foreshadowing of something terrible and unprecedented yet to come. Despite the
            public conjecture and curiosity, none have discovered what lies beneath his alloyed exterior. What is known
            is this: Mordekaiser arrived unannounced at the Institute one day and, with a rasp that crept ice up the
            spines of all within earshot, requested to join the League of Legends.\n\n

            Upon glimpsing his fearful visage, most keep their distance, fortunately unaware that his touch bears a
            sinister scourge. Those who stumble within his grasp fall victim to incurable maladies. In fact,
            Mordekaiser
            seems mystically attuned to sickness, as if it feeds and comprises part of his chilling essence. He now
            stalks the slums of Noxus, drawn to the plague-ridden and diseased. However, there is something in his
            clever tactics, something in his noble stance, and something in the tone of his unearthly commands that has
            led many to believe that Mordekaiser is more than just a foot soldier. Some see the distinguishing
            characteristics of a general. While many have learned to accept the evidence of this unsettling
            possibility,
            a lingering questions keeps them wary at the witching hour: if Mordekaiser is a general, what nightmarish
            legion lurks at his command?\n\n

            where
            an ancient conflict still rages. Like so many conflicts, this war split families. One side proclaimed
            themselves as beings of perfect order and justice, fighting to unite the world under their law and strong
            central governance. Those that fought against them saw their kin as tyrants, creatures incapable of seeing
            the larger view, who would sacrifice individuality and freedom for the illusion of efficiency and safety.
            Morgana was one who fought against what she perceived as the tyranny of her kind, and for that she was
            branded \'fallen.\' Morgana was not innocent, having plumbed forgotten ways to gather forbidden might to
            become a powerful mistress of the black arts. This goal was driven by her obsession to defeat the general
            of
            the opposition\'s army - her sister, Kayle.\n\n

            While the two were in fact birth-sisters, Kayle struck the first blow by disowning any filial connection
            when Morgana refused to join her cause. Eventually, Morgana grew in power enough to not only reach, but
            challenge Kayle. As the time approached when the two would meet in what could be their final conflict,
            Morgana was suddenly summoned to Valoran. At first, Morgana made a deal with the League\'s summoners to
            fight in exchange for greater power. With the advent of Kayle into the League, Morgana now willingly fights
            in the League of Legends for the privilege of being able to destroy her sister again, and again, and again.
            She lies in wait for the day the bonds of the Institute of War no longer hold her,
            and on that day she plans
            to destroy Kayle once and for all and return home a hero.\n\n

        <item>The enigmatic creature known as Nasus came to the League from a faraway world, and served as part of a
            vast and learned desert empire. There he was a respected and enlightened individual, having been made the
            Keeper of the Great Library. However, he was also part of a race of animalistic creatures that served as
            the
            rulers and protectors of the people. Unfortunately, there were others of his kind that believed they were
            more than protectors. They were under the egotistical delusion that they had ascended to become gods. War
            on
            Nasus\'s world was never more than a breath away, as these deluded others sought to enslave the people and
            establish a totalitarian sovereignty. In the midst of a heated battle, just as Nasus was about to slay his
            treacherous brother Renekton, he was pulled through the cosmos to a summoning circle in Runeterra.\n\n

            At first angered that he had been taken just as he was about to cripple the enemies of his people, Nasus\'
            advanced intellect won out when he heard the pleas of mercy from the summoners. He learned that Runeterra
            was also filled with its own brand of injustice. This danger was no less threatening than what he had
            fought
            against at home, and champions were needed to protect the people of this world. Heeding the call, Nasus
            chose to take his place in the League of Legends, knowing that his brothers and sisters would carry on the
            fight back home. These days, he is the Curator of the Sands, feeling most at home in the crumbling ruins of
            the Shurima Desert. However, recent disturbing news has reached the Keeper\'s ears - rumors that perhaps
            his
            brother had not in fact been left behind. If this were the case, the destruction of Renekton would quickly
            become Nasus\' main priority, before this world too faces the threads of his brother\'s forked-tongue and
            endless ambition.\n\n

        <item>There are few dwellers, let alone champions, residing in the blasted and dangerous lands that lie south
            of
            the Great Barrier. Much of that world still bears the scars of past Runes Wars, especially the mysterious
            Kumungu Jungle. There are long-forgotten treasures in these strange places which many risk life and limb to
            acquire. The champion known as Nidalee was only a young girl travelling with her treasure-seeking parents
            when they lost their way in the dense, rainy jungles. The jungle was unforgiving, and she watched her
            parents suffer agonizing final days as they fell victim to a mysterious and vicious disease.\n\n

            As improbable as it was for a child to survive in the inhospitable jungle by herself,
            she did just that. Her
            youthful innocence and a fortunate naivete caused her to appeal to the beasts of that place and she was
            taken in by a family of cougars and raised as one of their own. She grew and somehow absorbed the raw magic
            of the dense wilds, evolving beyond both her human physiology and her feline affectation. On one pivotal
            day
            in her life, standing over the torn remnants of a Noxian squad of woodcutters, Nidalee chose to rejoin the
            so-called civilized world, to fight in the League of Legends so as to protect the vast woods from both
            Demacia and Noxus.\n\n

            Nidalee was taught to fight by her feline family, battling viciously with tooth and nail. Something in her

        <item>Before Nocturne, people believed that dreams were figments of their imagination, meaningless images that
            flashed through the mind when one slept. This belief was put to the test when a rash of sleep-related
            incidents started afflicting summoners of the League. Some would wake up screaming, terrified and beyond
            consolation. Some could not fall asleep, slowly going mad as the nights ticked by. Some simply never woke
            up. Physicians were baffled until a Field Architect happened to pass out next to a nexus on Twisted
            Treeline. Witnesses said he cried out once and then stopped breathing. Immediately after, magical energy
            arced out from the nexus, and Nocturne appeared.\n\n

            Nocturne did not take his introduction to this world kindly. He slaughtered everything he could find before
            summoners were able to magically confine him. After a period of intense study, League experts divined that
            Nocturne hunted summoners in their sleep, attacking them in a place where their magic was useless. This
            seemed to be his only purpose. The families of the victims demanded justice, but League officials were
            concerned that death might only return Nocturne to the place from which he came. They bound him to a nexus
            fragment, trapping him in the physical world. As punishment for his crimes, they allowed summoners to call
            upon Nocturne in the League matches, bending his will to the summoners he hates and creating his own
            personal nightmare. League scholars don\'t know whether he truly came from the plane of dreams, or whether
            there are any more like him. Some theorize that the summoning act affected summoners\' subconscious minds,
            luring Nocturne to them in their sleep. Perhaps the most disturbing theory is that Nocturne is a person\'s
            nightmare come to life. If this is true, they wonder, who is the dreamer?\n\n

        <item>Freljord is an unforgiving land covered in snow and ice. Travel, especially in the winter, can be very
            dangerous. The elements often claim even those who have spent their entire lives there. The boy known as
            Nunu is defined by such tragedy. One day when he was a young child, Nunu rode on his father\'s back as they
            returned from a trapping expedition in the mountains. An unexpected blizzard came upon them,
            forcing them to
            seek refuge in a cave. The tempest was the worst in countless years, and it lasted for days. Nunu\'s father
            left to find food, but he never returned.\n\n

            The blizzard eventually cleared, and the young child lay dying on the mountainside. Fortunately for Nunu,
            this was the land of the yetis, who are powerful beasts with whom Nunu\'s father had secured and
            arrangement
            for safe passage. A young yeti boy named Willump found Nunu and brought him home. From then on Nunu was
            raised by the yetis, whose culture remains a mystery to most Runeterrans. The boy quickly discovered that
            the seemingly savage creatures were in fact deeply spiritual beings living in harmony with their
            environment. They are very territorial and unafraid of defending themselves if called upon to do so. The
            yetis have watched the rest of Valoran, and they can smell the change on the wind. When the League of
            Legends was formed, the yetis knew they needed a champion. Riding his brother Willump, Nunu became that
            champion. Those who follow the League know that the boy is mature beyond his years, but, while he appears
            human, his mind is that of his adoptive kin.\n\n

            resource. Olaf belonged to a seafaring clan known for ruthlessly pillaging any and all villages within
            reach
            of their dragon-crested longboats. The last time he saw his icy home, Olaf was embarking on an expedition
            to
            pioneer and plunder a distant land known only to legend. However, while underway,
            a terrible storm sprung up
            and Olaf and his crew were thrown to the mercy of a roiling and pitiless sea.\n\n

            His ship destroyed, his crew nowhere to be found, Olaf miraculously washed up untold miles from
            \'friendly\'
            waters on the foreign shores of Valoran, south of Demacia. This unfamiliar place stunned and frightened the
            Berserker, for Lokfar is not privy to such potent magicians. Approaching them, Olaf hoped that they could
            use their mysterious powers to send him back to his people. A bargain was struck. Olaf would use his
            awesome
            prowess as a warrior to serve the unusual wars of Valoran in the League of Legends, and in exchange the
            sorcerers would find him a way to return. Despite his participation in the League,
            Olaf knows better than to
            trust the \'finger wagglers\' that run the Institute of War. He deliberately keeps details of his life and
            home from them. After all, with enough information, they would most certainly find the Lokfarians and
            dominate them as they have dominated all of Valoran, keeping both quietly -- and unwittingly -- in their
            thrall.\n\n

            Beware the war cry of the Berserker. What surges toward you is unyielding,
            free from the shackles of reason.

        <item>There once was a Piltovian man named Corin Reveck who had a daughter named Orianna, whom he loved more
            than anything else in the world. Though Orianna had incredible talent for dancing,
            she was deeply fascinated
            by the champions of the League of Legends. This fascination compelled her to begin training to become
            such a
            champion. It is unfortunate that her sheltered, wide-eyed naivete led her to take unnecessary and dangerous
            chances which ultimately led to her tragic demise. Orianna\'s death shattered Corin, driving him into deep
            depression and an obsession with techmaturgy. He could not stand the void his daughter\'s death left in his
            life, so he decided to build a replacement - one that would complete Orianna\'s dream of joining the
            League.
            What was created is the clockwork killing machine that Corin named after his daughter. Knowing that she was
            destined to be a champion and seeing the way the times were changing, he created The Ball as her pet and
            protector. This nearly symbiotic creation uses a different type of techmaturgy, relying more heavily on
            electricity than clockwork.\n\n

            Orianna and The Ball now fight as Champions in the League of Legends,
            using her sometimes misguided morality
            as a compass. She tries in earnest to fit in with those around her. However, no matter how hard she tries,
            Orianna can never be human and there is always something unnerving and alien about her. Though she attempts
            social interaction with other champions in the League of Legends, there are few who can get past her exotic
            nature. To many, it\'s as if there\'s nothing inside, that Orianna is just a soulless clockwork shell - a
            dangerous and deadly one at that. However, all along she remains the perfect daughter in her father\'s
            eyes.\n\n

        <item>Far above the clouds on Mount Targon resides a stalwart tribe of people known as the Rakkor who still
            revere combat and war as ultimate artforms. They remember the Rune Wars of Runeterra and know that the
            League of Legends can only repress the rising tides of violence for so long. Each member of the tribe is
            bred to be a disciplined and vicious warrior, preferring to battle soldiers of either the Noxian or
            Demacian
            armies only when outnumbered at least ten to one. Rakkor warriors are trained not only to be as lethal with
            their bare hands as the most capable martial artists, but also to fiercely wield the many relic-weapons of
            the tribe. Such treasures have been handed down from generation to generation, and have harnessed the
            mystical nature of Runeterra in their very cores. These relic-weapons are among the most dangerous in
            existence - and it comes as no surprise that they have found their way to the League of Legends in the
            hands
            of Pantheon.\n\n

            This stone-faced warrior is a paragon of his people, his very existence an anthem of exultation to the art
            of combat. Pantheon found it insulting that the people of Valoran would install an organization to replace
            war, complete with so-called champions, without including the Rakkor. Gathering the blessings of his tribe
            and armed with the relics of his ancestors, he has descended on the League to show the world a true
            warrior.
            He cares not who he fights, and cares nothing for the pageantry or prestige of a League champion, but lives
            only for the austere glory of battle. As long as Pantheon breathes, he thirsts for another foe to
            vanquish.\n\n

            \'I was hoping they had more reinforcements.\' - Pantheon, standing amidst the pieces of a brutalized

        <item>While other young yordle girls played skip-step and braided wreathes out of posies, Poppy spent her youth
            earning calluses and grease stains in her father\'s armor shop. Blomgrun, her father, was Bandle City\'s
            finest smith. The only thing he loved as much as his work was his young daughter, Poppy - named for the
            sprightly sounds of the sparks that leapt from his ever-burning forge. He welled with pride the day she was
            first able to lift his trusty hammer, Whomper. Poppy immediately took to his art, demonstrating a natural
            gift for smithing, which Blomgrun honed with devoted instruction.\n\n

            One day, a Demacian general named Florin Berell commissioned Blomgrun to craft a helm, glorious beyond
            comparison. Blomgrun toiled away on this project, determined to present Florin with his finest work. He let
            Poppy set the center jewel, entrusting her with the most important piece. When the pair finished, they
            departed for Demacia to deliver it in person. Word of the general\'s order, however, was leaked to the
            Noxian High Command, and two Noxian assassins were dispatched to intercept the delivery. Blomgrun was able
            to occupy the assassins long enough for Poppy to escape with the prized helm. She watched helplessly from
            the brush as her father was slain. Instead of fleeing home, she carried the helm the rest of the way to
            Demacia alone. She refused payment for it, saying that no amount would compensate for her father\'s life.
            Instead, she offered it as a gift, honoring her father\'s final intentions. Florin saw the grim
            determination behind the tears in her eyes, and requested that the leadership of Bandle City appoint Poppy
            as the yordle ambassador to Demacia. Soon after, seeking to crush Noxus with her father\'s hammer, Poppy
            volunteered for the League of Legends.\n\n

        <item>Ravaged by Rune Wars long past, the lands south of the Great Barrier are wrecked by chaotic magical
            storms, leaving the grasp of nature\'s rule tenuous at best. While abnormal flora or fauna are the norm
            rather than the exception in these ruined areas, perhaps none is more curious than the case of Rammus.
            While
            no one is entirely certain why an armadillo from the Shurima Desert crossed the Kumungu Jungle into the
            Plague Jungles, Rammus made just such a journey. There, amongst the twisted vines and festering rot,
            he came
            across an oddity - a healthy evergreen hedge maze, stretching as far as the eye could see. As he explored
            the maze, something compelled him toward its center - a light, a presence of some kind. As he drew closer,
            the light surged, blinding him and knocking him unconscious.\n\n

            When he awoke, Rammus\' whole world had changed. The maze had vanished and he felt truly cognizant for the
            first time in his otherwise unremarkable life. As his predicament dawned on him, Rammus had a moment of
            panic. As he trembled, the earth around him began to shake, the intensity increasing until he managed to
            steady himself. As the quake receded, Rammus arose and left the Plague Jungles in search of others like
            him.
            His search brought him across all the lands south of the Great Barrier, but everywhere he went, he was
            unique.The hardships of this sojourn inspired him to craft the suit of armor that would earn him the title
            of Armordillo. Rammus\' quest eventually drew him to the only place where a sentient armadillo is less than
            confounding - the League of Legends.\n\n

        <item>On a faraway world, Renekton was born a member of a race of bestial guardians created to serve as the
            rulers and protectors of their people. Alongside his brother Nasus, Renekton oversaw the upkeep of the
            Great
            Library, which served as both a vault of ancient knowledge and the repository of the teachings of the Cycle
            of Life and Death. While the enlightened Nasus taught those scholars who came to study, Renekton served as
            the Great Library\'s gatekeeper. He could sense the true natures of those who sought Nasus\' teachings, and
            he sent away those with dark ambitions. Over time, however, his repeated exposure to this evil infected his
            mind. He grew furious with the malevolence in the hearts of men, and as he descended deeper into madness,
            he
            discovered he could quell the fury by cutting the evil from the men who possessed it. Unfortunately, the
            relief was as short-lived as the subjects, and the \'butcher\s rage\', as it came to be known,
            would resurge
            even stronger.\n\n

            Consumed by his anger, Renekton turned on the one being who could defeat him -- his own brother. Nasus
            pleaded with Renekton to see reason. Realizing that he was beyond redemption,
            the despondent Nasus valiantly
            struck down his wayward sibling. Defenseless, Renekton waited eagerly for death\'s release. It never came.
            He was spared when summoners from the League of Legends claimed his brother. Caught in the wake of this
            powerful spell, Renekton tumbled for what seemed like ages between realities. When he finally emerged, he
            fell deep into the sewers of Zaun. Insane with fury, Renekton languished in his newfound home, driven
            senseless by his rage. That is until, by happenstance, he caught a familiar scent in the air. Believing
            that
            the familiar scent would guide him to the solace that was fading from his memory, he traced his brother to
            the Institute of War.\n\n

        <item>In Noxus, any citizen may rise to power regardless of race, gender, or social standing - strength is all
            that matters. It was with committed faith in this ideal that Riven strove to greatness. She showed early
            potential as a soldier, forcing herself to master the weight of a long sword when she was barely its
            height.
            She was ruthless and efficient as a warrior, but her true strength lay in her conviction. She entered
            battles without any trace of doubt in her mind: no ethical pause, no fear of death. Riven became a leader
            amongst her peers, poster child of the Noxian spirit. So exceptional was her passion that the High Command
            recognized her with a black stone rune sword forged and enchanted with Noxian sorcery. The weapon was
            heavier than a kite shield and nearly as broad - perfectly suited to her tastes. Soon after, she was
            deployed to Ionia as part of the Noxian invasion.\n\n

            What began as war quickly became extermination. Noxian soldiers followed the terrifying Zaunite war
            machines
            across fields of death. It wasn\'t the glorious combat for which Riven trained. She carried out the orders
            of her superiors, terminating the remnants of a beaten and fractured enemy with extreme prejudice. As the
            invasion continued, it became clear that the Ionian society would not be reformed,
            merely eliminated. During
            one bitter engagement, Riven\'s unit became surrounded by Ionian forces. They called for support as the
            enemy closed in around them. What they received instead was a barrage of biochemical terror launched by
            Singed. Riven watched as around her Ionian and Noxian alike fell victim to an unspeakably gruesome fate.
            She
            managed to escape the bombardment, though she could not erase the memory. Counted dead by Noxus, she saw an
            opportunity to start anew. She shattered her sword, severing ties with the past, and wandered in
            self-imposed exile - on a quest to seek atonement and a way to save the pure Noxian vision in which she
            believed.\n\n

        <item>Even amongst yordles, Rumble was always the runt of the litter. As such, he was used to being bullied. In
            order to survive, he had to be scrappier and more resourceful than his peers. He developed a quick temper
            and a reputation for getting even, no matter who crossed him. This made him something of a loner, but he
            didn\'t mind. He liked to tinker, preferring the company of gadgets,
            and he could usually be found rummaging
            through the junkyard. He showed great potential as a mechanic. His teachers recommended him for enrollment
            at the Yordle Academy of Science and Progress in Piltover, where he may very well have become one of
            Heimerdinger\'s esteemed proteges, but Rumble refused to go. He believed that Heimerdinger and his
            associates were \'sellouts,\' trading superior yordle technology to humans for nothing more than a pat on
            the head while yordles remained the butt of their jokes. When a group of human graduates from the Yordle
            Academy sailed to Bandle City to visit the place where their mentor was born and raised, Rumble couldn\'t
            resist the temptation to see them face-to-face (so to speak). He only intended to get a good look at the
            humans, but four hours and several choice words later, he returned home bruised and bloodied with an earful
            about how he was an embarrassment to \'enlightened\' yordles like Heimerdinger. The next morning he left
            Bandle City without a word, and wasn\'t seen again for months. When he returned, he was at the helm of a
            clanking, mechanized monstrosity. He marched it to the center of town amidst dumbfounded onlookers and
            there
            announced that he would join the League of Legends to show the world what yordle-tech was really capable

        <item>There are many on Runeterra who are attracted to the study of magic or, in recent times, the emerging
            field of techmaturgy. For most, pursuit of such knowledge is formalized in a college or university. The
            halls of traditional study were never for Ryze, however, who felt a more raw and primal connection to the
            magic of Runeterra than those who tried to teach him. He struck out on his own as a young man to discover
            what already called to him. Ryze traveled the world, seeking the wisdom of powerful hermits, witches, and
            shamans - anyone who had something to share beyond what was taught in the city-states of Valoran. When he
            had learned all he could from these fonts of wisdom, Ryze turned to seek the lost, forgotten, and forbidden
            knowledge in the world, delving into mystical worlds where others feared to tread.\n\n

            Ryze\'s tireless searching for magical knowledge led him to an ancient form of spellcraft known as thorn
            magic. This art required Ryze to tattoo spells on his body, permanently infusing his being with vast arcane
            power and finally fulfilling his need to bond with the mystical energies of Runeterra. His travels also led
            him to uncover the giant indestructible scroll he now carries on his back - the purpose of the inscribed
            spell remains a secret only Ryze knows. He claims it is an abomination - something that he must safeguard
            from the world. This has piqued the curiosity of many, though no one is sure how to separate the scroll
            from
            Ryze, or if it is possible to overcome the rogue mage to do so. Since then, Ryze has joined the League of
            Legends to study the magical creatures and powerful will-workers that fight there, in order to complete his
            exploration of mystical Runeterra.\n\n

            When Sejuani was born, the mystics of her tribe foretold that she would be the one to unite and lead the divided territories of Freljord. Her people had suffered for centuries, as a losing war on the frozen tundra pushed them farther and farther from Freljord\'s limited food supplies. Sejuani grew up surrounded by this misery, and it fueled her desire to fulfill her destiny. She pushed herself to extremes, walking out into blizzards without food or furs and training while frigid winds raked her flesh. She sparred with the strongest warriors of her tribe, one after another, until her legs would give out beneath her. She sustained injuries that would have killed any other member of the tribe, but she would only rise again, driven by sheer force of will and what her tribe took to calling her \'heart of the blizzard.\'\n\n

            On her twentieth birthday, Sejuani declared that she would lead her people out of their remote isolation to conquer the lands of their enemies. She had completed her training and she was ready to face the leaders of the opposing tribes. Her feats had already become legend and soldiers in her company were inspired to new heights of strength and resolve. However, before she struck out on her campaign, Ashe began campaigning for peace in Freljord, joining the League of Legends to demonstrate how the people could be spared violence. To Sejuani, this was a violation of tradition - a coward\'s ruse to hoard Freljord\'s precious few resources. She saw the confidence of her people wane as it seemed they would never be delivered from their plight. She decided that to truly prove herself as the rightful ruler of Freljord, she must defeat Ashe completely and unquestionably on the world\'s stage in the League of Legends.\n\n

        <item>Most would say that death isn\'t funny. It isn\'t, unless you\'re Shaco - then it\'s hysterical. He is
            Valoran\'s first fully functioning homicidal comic; he jests until someone dies, and then he laughs. The
            figure that has come to be known as the Demon Jester is an enigma. No one fully agrees from whence he came,
            and Shaco never offers any details on his own. A popular belief is that Shaco is not of Runeterra - that he
            is a thing summoned from a dark and twisted world. Still others believe that he is the demonic manifestation
            of humanity\'s dark urges and therefore cannot be reasoned with. The most plausible belief is that Shaco is
            an assassin for hire, left to his own lunatic devices until his services are needed. Shaco certainly has
            proven himself to be a cunning individual, evading authorities at every turn who might seek him for
            questioning for some horrendous, law-breaking atrocity. While such scuttlebutt might reassure the native
            inhabitants of Valoran, it seems unimaginable that such a malfeasant figure is allowed to remain at
            large.\n\n

            Whatever the truth of his history might be, Shaco has joined the League of Legends for reasons only he
            knows. He is a terrifying figure, typically shunned by both his fellow champions and the media at large.
            Only the summoners in the Institute of War know why such a creature was allowed into the League, but most
            Runeterrans suspect it to be a means that allows the power that be to keep an eye on the ever-elusive Shaco.
            Unsurprisingly, this champion is popular in places where madness can openly reign, such as among the
            power-hungry summoners of Zaun and Noxus.\n\n

        <item>There exists an ancient order originating in the Ionian Isles dedicated to the preservation of balance.
            Order, chaos, light, darkness -- all things must exist in perfect harmony for such is the way of the
            universe. This order is known as the Kinkou and it employs a triumvirate of shadow warriors to uphold its
            causes in the world. Shen is one of these shadow warriors, entrusted with the sacred duty of Watching the
            Stars - exercising judgment untainted by prejudice.\n\n

            Born to a clan whose members have decorated the ranks of the Kinkou for generations, Shen was trained his
            entire life to become the Eye of Twilight, and thereupon to dispassionately determine what must be done in
            the interests of equilibrium. As his final trial to ascend to this position, he was made to attend the
            Takanu, a ceremony in which his father was tortured before his eyes to test his resolve. Any reaction
            whatsoever would have resulted in his immediate disqualification, but he never averted his gaze and never
            blinked, not once. As the Eye of Twilight, Shen must make decisions that would buckle the wills of ordinary
            men, removing all emotion from the equation. He now works with his fellows Akali and Kennen to enforce the
            balance of Valoran. This hallowed pursuit has unsurprisingly led the triumvirate to the Fields of
            Justice.\n\n

            surprise when his hunt led him to a legendary young half-dragon. She wept over the dead, mutilated corpse of
            her father, murdered for her existence. Something in Jarvan was moved by Shyvana\'s plight. Together they
            plotted revenge against the mighty dragon resposible. The assault cost the Demacian Prince many men, and
            nearly his life, but ultimately Shyvana and he prevailed.\n\n

            The experience changed the both of them. Shyvana lost her place in the world, left alone to be hunted by
            those dragons who discovered her existence. Because of what he\'d seen, Jarvan lost his taste for the hunt
            and wished to return home as protector of his people. Jarvan IV, as Crown Prince of Demacia, offered Shyvana
            a place as a noble warrior in the ranks of the elite guard. Out of gratitude and necessity, she accepted.
            Since their return to Demacia, Shyvana has proven herself to be a fierce and powerful soldier. She blends
            her fiery draconian blood with her adopted principles of justice. She revels in the power she now feels in
            the human world and there are few who do not quake before her in combat. However, by and large there remains
            only one place for glorious battle. When Jarvan joined the League of Legends, it wasn\'t long before Shyvana
            answered the call as well.\n\n

        <item>Singed descended from a long line of Zaun\'s revered chemists. Even in his youth, his talent for
            concocting potions far outstripped that of his peers, and he quickly distinguished himself from his less
            extraordinary chemist compatriots. It came as no surprise to anyone when he was selected for apprenticeship
            by the infamous Warwick, master apothecary on a lucrative retainer with the Noxian military during their
            campaign against Ionia. Within Warwick\'s laboratories, Singed toiled without end, rapidly absorbing every
            detail of his predecessor\'s deadly craft. Singed had little concern for the death and destruction that was
            the fruit of his labors. By the time the curse of lycanthropy descended to claim his master, Singed was
            poised and eager to make the transition from workhorse to innovator; he was ready to share his genius by
            bringing a new brand of suffering to the Ionian front. His zeal for progress was unquenchable, and when
            suitable test subjects proved to be in short supply, the eager chemist was often thought to turn his
            volatile mixtures on his own flesh.\n\n

            When the uneasy peace created by the League of Legends settled on the world, Singed journeyed to the one
            place where he was still able to showcase his beloved craft: the Institute of War. By this time he was
            barely even a man, his body both ruined and sustained by his ingenious craft. A thousand burns - accidents
            of shadow and flame - mar his ravaged form, and exposure to such harsh conditions has deadened his nerves,
            hardened his body, and strengthened his physique, transforming him into a veritable juggernaut. This,
            combined with a formidable arsenal of deadly concoctions, makes Singed a force to be reckoned with on the
            Fields of Justice.\n\n

        <item>Prior to the creation of the League of Legends, the city-states of Demacia and Noxus were locked in a
            brutal series of on-again-off-again wars that spanned the course of centuries. Both powers sought an
            advantage over the other, but Noxus was the city-state willing to forego conventional morality to achieve
            its goals. Only brute strength and the will to use it mattered to Noxus, and this is best exemplified in the
            murderous warrior, Sion. Used by the Noxians as a human battering ram, Sion would be sent thundering ahead
            of Noxian troops. He would mercilessly slaughter foes with his large double-bladed axe, \'Chopper\'. His
            complete disregard for caution ultimately cost him his life, as he was captured and summarily executed by
            Demacian forces.\n\n

            The Demacians thought that the beheading of Sion would be the end of his bloodthirsty ways. Death, however,
            was merely the beginning of Sion\'s rise to power. The famed Noxian assassin, Katarina, recovered Sion\'s
            remains and Noxian necromancers reanimated the behemoth to serve Noxus once again. Sion\'s reanimation
            actually bestowed new powers on him and increased the potency of his existing abilities, making him even
            more of a terror to behold on the battlefield. The Noxian High Command had a powerful new weapon in their
            hands - one they have brought to bear as a champion in the League of Legends. Even though Sion\'s increased
            powers would make him a powerful tool for the High Command\'s use outside the Fields of Justice, Noxus no
            longer risks losing one of their greatest champions in the League to chance or circumstance; Sion\'s days as
            a front-line fighter for Noxus\' military conquests are at an end.\n\n

        <item>The beautiful and deadly champion known as Sivir has been a favorite of League summoners for close to a
            decade. A soldier-for-hire outside of the Fields of Justice, she is the embodiment of a highly successful
            mercenary on modern day Runeterra. Sivir has little interest in the \'cribbage sheets\' - as she calls them
            - of League influence bartering. Instead, she is motivated by material wealth and riches, and she is paid
            handsomely for her services. Sivir is one of the wealthiest individuals found anywhere on Valoran. Sivir
            owns multiple residences in a number of different city-states, as well as ownership stakes in a number of
            businesses all across Valoran. Her detractors, either envious of her success or acrimonious of her flexible
            morality, have begun to use Sivir as a symbol of what is wrong with the mercenary nature of the League.
            Sivir dismisses her critics, saying that while her personal code of ethics is less ruthless than her
            competitors, \'Everyone has a price.\'\n\n

            Sivir has earned many titles and accolades throughout her illustrious career, but the one she held until
            recently was \'Battle Mistress of Noxus\'. Now she is simply known as \'The Battle Mistress\' after breaking
            her contract with the Noxian High Command. Sivir dared to object to the Noxian war against the peaceful
            island state of Ionia, though less about the morality of the issue than the planning behind it; her
            predictions of a bloody stalemate came true when the Ionians held off the relentless assaults of the
            Noxians. Claiming that the Noxian High Command had lost its direction, she left Noxus and made her services
            available to the Institute of War. The Noxian High Command has sent a number of contracted assassins to deal
            with its rogue mercenary, but none have delivered her or survived.\n\n

        <item>Centuries ago, there lived a race of creatures as ferocious as they were wise. The brackern were unusual
            beings blessed with the earth\'s primal magic, embodied in the form of crystals. Their kind knew of an
            arcane ritual to bind their life\'s essence to a crystal, communing with the magic embedded in it. With this
            power, the brackern thrived in the Odyn Valley, protecting both creatures and crystals alike. Despite
            attacks from those looking to claim the primal magic, it seemed that nothing could get past the brackern\'s
            defenses. Nothing, that is, until the devastation of a Rune War.\n\n

            A vicious battle was fought near the Odyn Valley and the unleashed chaotic magic poisoned the crystals. The
            brackern began to grow sick and die, and no amount of defensive magic could reverse the effects. To avoid
            extinction, their only course was to hibernate underground until the wars stopped. The strongest, most
            intelligent brackern hibernated closer to the surface to awaken first and assess the world\'s condition for
            the return of their race. The recent mining operations and violent escalation in Kalamanda were enough to
            awaken the first of these vanguards. When Skarner burst to the surface, he lashed out in anger and
            confusion. Reason eventually won out over his anger when he realized that the agents of the League who found
            him were simply functionaries. Skarner was invited to the Institute of War to share the brackern\'s story.
            In return, the summoners told him about the history that his kind had slept through. Much had been done to
            curb the unchecked use of magic since the Rune Wars, but it was obvious that the world was not yet safe for
            his kind to reawaken. For now, however, there is a place where Skarner can use his power to change the world
            into one to which his kind could eventually return: the League of Legends.\n\n

        <item>Sona has no memories of her true parents. As an infant, she was found abandoned on the doorstep of an
            Ionian adoption house, nestled atop an ancient instrument in an exquisite case of unknown origins. She was
            an unusually well-behaved child, always quiet and content. Her caretakers were sure she would find a home
            quickly, but it soon became apparent that what they mistook for uncommon geniality was actually an inability
            to speak or to produce any sound whatsoever. Sona remained at the adoption house until her teens, watching
            in hopeless silence as prospective adopters passed her by. During this time, the caretakers sold her unusual
            instrument to anxious collectors, hoping to build her a trust. For a myriad of bizarre and unexpected
            reasons, however, it would be returned, or simply appear again outside the house.\n\n

            When a wealthy Demacian woman named Lestara Buvelle learned of the instrument, she immediately embarked to
            Ionia. When the caretakers showcased the instrument for her, she rose wordlessly and explored the house,
            stopping outside Sona\'s room. Without hesitation, Lestara adopted her and left a generous donation for the
            instrument. With Lestara\'s guidance, Sona discovered a deep connection with the instrument which Lestara
            called an \'etwahl\'. In her hands, it played tones which stilled or quivered the hearts of those around
            her. Within months, she was headlining with the mysterious etwahl for sold-out audiences. She played as
            though plucking heartstrings, effortlessly manipulating the emotions of her listeners - all without a single
            written note. In secret, she discovered a potent and deadly use for her etwahl, using its vibrations to
            slice objects from a distance. She honed this discipline in private, mastering her gift. When she felt
            prepared, she went to the only place which could offer her a fitting recital: the League of Legends.\n\n

        <item>Soraka, the Starchild of Ionia, was the first of her kind. While there are many who tap into the rich
            magical energies of Valoran, she was the first to tap into the magic of the cosmos itself - the celestial
            sea in which it is theorized that Runeterra swims among other like bodies. While Runeterran magicians are
            limited by the finite (though tremendous) powers of runes, there have always been those who have searched to
            go further. Reaching beyond the terrestrial firmament of Runeterra, Soraka was capable of invoking the power
            of the stars, evolving beyond her kin. This power has changed her in fantastical ways - it is for this
            reason that she became known as the Starchild.\n\n

            Though Soraka was once trans-human, Soraka has fallen since she let the most primal of emotions rule her.
            Warwick, a mercenary chemist in the service of Noxus, had caused untold suffering and death among Soraka\'s
            people. An alchemical genius who took no responsibility for the atrocities he\'d caused, Warwick became
            known as \'the Deathmaker\' by the Ionian people. As Noxian murder and terror pushed ever-forward across her
            land, unstoppable anger and hatred welled within Soraka. She called down the power of the heavens to curse
            and forever change the Deathmaker, and she mutated the man into a werewolf - a wild, murderous beast. For
            this misstep, Soraka lost much of her power, sacrificing her trans-human ascension and sliding several steps
            down the evolutionary ladder in an instant. Though she is still a champion of the Ionian people, Soraka has
            joined the League of Legends in hopes of reversing her curse and redeeming herself in the eyes of the
            stars.\n\n

            Though having fallen from grace, Soraka is nonetheless determined to once again be one with the stars.

        <item>The earliest account of Swain\'s existence comes from a Noxian infirmary doctor\'s notes. According to
            them, Swain limped into the ward without cry or complaint; his right leg was snapped in half, with bone
            protruding from the skin. A small, scowling bird seemed affixed to his shoulder. The doctor gawked in horror
            as the young adolescent answered questions about his health and age with a calm, even stare. Even behind the
            echoing crack as the sand counterweights reset his tibia, Swain\'s measuring gaze never flickered, nor did
            his eyes twitch from the pop of his fibula. He refused the doctor\'s recommendation of magical treatment for
            the leg\'s inoperable damage, requesting only a spare crutch before shuffling away. He next surfaced in
            documents from the Noxian military, although it is evident that they are incomplete. Normally a crippled boy
            would be turned away in shame from Noxus\' proud legion, but the records indicate his first designation was
            that of a ranking officer.\n\n

            The men who\'ve served under him (and survived) have remained in his charge with unshakable faith and
            loyalty. He leapt through the High Command\'s hierarchy, often ascending when superiors requested demotions
            to join his unit. A cunning strategist, Swain was decorated after every battle he fought, regularly hobbling
            in contemplation at the front of the assault. His rise to power seemed unceasing until he was suddenly
            relegated to inactive status prior to the Ionian Invasion - a bewildering decision which reeked of
            bureaucratic subversion. If Swain was upset by the events which unfolded, he never belied it. His face was
            so implacable that it was popularly rumored to be a mask, disguising something utterly inhuman beneath. More
            controversy surrounded the bird that never left his shoulder, whose name he whispered only to it. When
            Demacia escalated its presence in the League, Swain was immediately returned to active duty.\n\n

        <item>Talon\'s earliest memories are the darkness of Noxus\' underground passages and the reassuring steel of a
            blade. He remembers no family, warmth, or kindness. Instead, the clink of stolen gold and the security of a
            wall at his back are all the kinship he has ever craved. Kept alive only by his quick wits and deft
            thievery, Talon scraped out a living in the seedy underbelly of Noxus. His mastery of the blade quickly
            marked him as a threat, and Noxian guilds sent assassins to him with a demand: join their ranks or be
            killed. He left the bodies of his pursuers dumped in Noxus\' moat as his response.\n\n

            The assassination attempts grew increasingly dangerous until one assailant met Talon blade-for-blade in a
            match of strength. To his surprise, Talon was disarmed and facing down his executioner\'s sword when the
            assassin revealed himself to be General Du Couteau. The General offered Talon the choice between death at
            his hand, or life as an agent of the Noxian High Command. Talon chose life, on the condition that his
            service was to Du Couteau alone, for the only type of orders he could respect were from one he could not
            defeat. Talon remained in the shadows, carrying out secret missions on Du Couteau\'s orders that took him
            from the frigid lands of Freljord to the inner sanctums of Bandle City. When the general vanished, Talon
            considered reclaiming his freedom, but he had gained immense respect for Du Couteau after years in his
            service. He became obsessed with tracking down the general\'s whereabouts. Talon\'s suspicions led him to
            the doors of the Institute of War, where he joined the League of Legends in order to find those responsible
            for Du Couteau\'s disappearance.\n\n

        <item>There is a form of magic unknown to many Runeterrans and discredited by the few who are even aware of its
            existence. It is the magic of the earth, drawing power from the resonance of crystals and gems. Taric, the
            Gem Knight, is Runeterra\'s sole practitioner of this form of magic, having been erratically summoned to
            Runeterra from a faraway world. Back home, Taric\'s father was a distinguished healer in their home city.
            Taric was always interested in his father\'s pursuits, even from a young age. Despite his burgeoning
            understanding of herbs, plants, and animal medicines, it was the power of gems that most fascinated the
            growing boy. It wasn\'t long before Taric had exhausted his father\'s coveted library and set out on a path
            of his own. He wanted to help the people, but not by simply salving their wounds and curing their woes. He
            wasn\'t to be a healer, but a defender - one who used the power of earth to preserve and protect.\n\n

            Taric became a wandering knight, renowned across his homeland as a guardian of the just until the day a
            spell of summoning grabbed him from his home and deposited him on Runeterra. Though disoriented and confused
            at first, he now feels that the continent of Valoran is in need of someone like him. Despite missing his
            homeland, Taric is happy to fight in the League, serving as a protector for all who seek one. His neat and
            stylish appearance combined with his shiny bejeweled armor and weapons have rapidly made him a celebrity
            champion of the League of Legends. Valoran\'s media, for some reason, has taken great interested in his
            personal life. While open about his life as a champion and gracious in all things, Taric is tight-lipped
            about his life outside the League and prefers his privacy.\n\n

        <item>Teemo is a legend among his yordle brothers and sisters in Bandle City. As far as yordles are concerned,
            there is something just slightly off about him. While Teemo enjoys the companionship of other yordles, he
            also insists on frequent solo missions in the ongoing defense of Bandle City. Despite his genuinely warm
            personality, something switches off inside Teemo\'s mind during combat so that the lives he must end while
            on patrol do not burden him. Even as a young recruit, the drill instructors and other trainees found it a
            little disconcerting that, while Teemo was normally charming and kind, he turned deadly serious and highly
            efficient the minute combat exercises began. Teemo\'s superiors quickly steered him toward the Scouts of the
            Mothership, which is one of Bandle City\'s most distinguished Special Forces unit alongside the Megling
            Commandos.\n\n

            While most yordles do not handle solo scouting missions with a great deal of finesse, Teemo is remarkably
            efficient at them. His record of success in defending Bandle City from infiltrators easily makes him one of
            the most dangerous yordles alive, though you\'d never know it by having a cup of honey mead with him at his
            favorite inn. Bandle City chose Teemo as their first champion for the League, and he has taken to it like a
            duck to water. His signature weapon - a blowgun - uses a rare ajunta poison he personally gathers from the
            jungles of Kumungu. To help cope with his lengthy periods of isolation, Teemo recently struck up a
            friendship with Tristana, a fellow League champion and fellow member of Bandle City\'s Special Forces. This
            connection is healthy for both yordles, though now Valoran\'s voracious media outlets circulate rumors that
            the friendship is turning into a romantic relationship. Regardless, Teemo is a crowd favorite in the League
            of Legends, and a pint-sized foe that many have come to fear.\n\n

        <item>The Megling Commandos are something of a legend in Bandle City. They have a history that spans centuries,
            and they remain the oldest yordle military unit still in service. They are renowned for their courage,
            deadliness, and ruthlessness, making them the most respected and feared of all warriors in Bandle City.
            Legends of Megling, the valiant founder of the commandos, are still heard throughout Valoran\'s taverns. It
            was these legends that most fascinated a young Tristana. Since she was a wee child, Tristana wanted nothing
            more than to become the crack shot that her idol had been all those years ago. She trained her entire life,
            until finally she was old enough to join the military and able to earn her place among the Megling
            Commandos. The senior officers were impressed by her abilities, claiming that Tristana was a natural, and
            her dream was realized the day she donned her Megling fatigues.\n\n

            Though her heart lies with her unit, the call to the League of Legends was irresistible and now Tristana
            protects Bandle City as a champion. While intense and focused as a Megling Gunner, Tristana is remarkably
            different in her personal life. Outside the Fields of Justice, she is friendly and cheerful - the sort of
            yordle who always has a kind word for everyone. Tristana recently struck up a close friendship with Teemo,
            the Swift Scout. They are both members of Bandle City\'s Special Forces, so not only do they bond as
            yordles, but also as fellow warriors and champions... though she outright ignores any questions pertaining
            to a blossoming romance.\n\n

            most intelligent beings. Despite their maleficent natures, however, the Ruhgosk never deserved the grisly
            fate that was visited upon them. Generations ago, a twisted necromancer known as Hakolin the Bonecrafter
            attempted to enslave the Ruhgosk tribe. These trolls are considerably more genteel than their ill-mannered
            brethren, although still uncouth by human standards. The Ruhgosk fought tooth and claw against the
            necromancer, ultimately driving him from their land. As a parting gift, Hakolin afflicted the trolls with a
            leprous disease, forever cursing the members of the tribe. The leprosy would have rotted their flesh away to
            nothing were it not for the trolls\' natural ability to regenerate. Caught forever in a hideous rotting
            state, the Ruhgosk endured their curse while desperately in search of a cure. They never found one.\n\n

            A wise Ruhgosk shaman learned that he could magically bind the disease to a single troll, provided that the
            troll could bear the weight of the entire tribe\'s curse upon himself. However, there was no such
            troll...until the birth of Trundle. His ability to regenerate was so profound that it appeared as if he did
            not carry the disease. As Trundle grew, he came to understand his gift and what it could do for his people.
            When he came of age, he took the curse from his tribe in a baptism of searing agony. Through the shaman\'s
            ritual, Trundle became a horrifying creature whose flesh constantly sloughs off his body, only to be
            re-grown in an unremitting cycle. He has joined the League of Legends in hopes of eventually finding someone
            who could dispel the heinous curse completely.\n\n

        <item>There are those who choose not to live in one of the great city-states of Valoran. Instead, they live in
            remote locales, often as part of a nomad or barbarian tribe. While perils abound in these untamed lands,
            there is also great freedom in being removed from the politics of Valoran. Tryndamere was born a member of
            one of these barbarian tribes in northern Valoran. Even as a young boy, it was obvious that he would grow in
            martial prowess to become one of his clan\'s greatest warriors. However, as his clan moved south between the
            Howling Marsh and the Ironspike Mountains, they came across strangers in black garb, brandishing symbols of
            a beast\'s skull. Despite Tryndamere\'s pleas, his elder went out to speak with the strangers; they cut him
            down mercilessly. From there, they began to slaughter every man, woman, and child in the clan. Tryndamere,
            the sole survivor, hid under the bodies of his dead parents. Upon their bloodied corpses, he swore eternal
            vengeance on those who took his people from him - the assassins of Noxus.\n\n

            To train himself, Tryndamere voluntarily served under all the great chieftains of the barbarian tribes,
            learning the ways of the barbarian warrior. Not only did this make him the man he needed to become in order
            to exact his revenge, it has also garnered him friends and allies among the most powerful barbarian leaders
            of Valoran. This recently allowed him to unite the barbarians into a single, powerful force - all under his
            command. Now he has joined the League of Legends to earn enough influence to find a permanent home for his
            people... and to slake his rage on the champions of his hated foes.\n\n

        <item>Although born to poor gypsy parents, the champion known as Twisted Fate was able to gamble his way to
            prosperity as a card shark in the seedy underground gambling circuits of Demacia and Noxus. No matter how
            close the authorities came to catching him, the rogue always found a way to slip through their fingers.
            Despite his good fortune, he was never able to win that which he truly desired - the ability to control
            magic. When Twisted Fate learned of an experiment being conducted in Zaun that might help him with his wish,
            he did the only thing a gambler of his worth could do - he went all in and volunteered for the
            experiment.\n\n

            Conducted by the infamous Dr. Xavier Rath, Twisted Fate was told that the wager for such participation might
            be steep. He might change forever, or nothing might happen, or he might die horribly. Pain, however, was
            likely a part of the deal no matter the outcome. These were hardly the worst odds the gambler had faced; his
            hopes raised, Twisted Fate underwent the experiment, enduring what he must for a chance at his dream. Then,
            it ended - with seemingly no effect whatsoever. The gypsy rogue flew into a murderous rage, but, before he
            could strike down the team, he suddenly teleported himself miles away. With a sly grin, he realized his luck
            had won out yet again. He now brings his luck and rakish charm to the Institute of War, where he is the
            Champion of choice for many - especially the gambling kind. To this day, Twisted Fate has avoided his
            inevitable reunion with Dr. Rath. The Card Master knows, however, that a confrontation is coming.\n\n

            While the future may be mysterious and unknown to most, Twisted Fate is certain that his future lies within
            the cards.

        <item>The city-state of Zaun is a twisted realm of science, mercantilism, and magic run amok. While the young
            science of techmaturgy does much to advance civilization, its research and use in Zaun pushes the boundaries
            of morality on a daily basis. Zaun, choked with pollution from the countless factories and laboratories that
            spew waste into the environment, suffers greatly. As polluted as Zaun is above-ground, its subterranean
            levels are far worse. All of Zaun\'s runoff waste pooled together in its sewers, mixing into a toxic and
            mysterious concoction. A single plague rat rose from this alchemical nightmare - Twitch. Unlike his lesser
            evolved cousins, Twitch became as sentient as anyone else... provided they were as insane as he. A seeming
            byproduct of the evolutionary brew that spawned him was maniacal insanity, albeit in a functional form.\n\n

            Twitch came to the League of Legends to represent himself \'as the only one of his kind\' on the Fields of
            Justice. Since then, he has found a generous benefactor in the city that gave him his evolutionary sentience
            - Zaun. Twitch is one of Zaun\'s premier champions in the League, and as such he fights for Zaun when
            political disputes between Valoran\'s city-states arise. Twitch has publically stated that his goal is to
            gain enough influence and materiel from his work in the League to try to recreate the process by which he
            gained his sentience. While many challenges lie ahead in his quest - one of the largest being his own
            insanity - were he to succeed, it would mean a bold and brazen step forward in the evolution of all of
            Runeterra. Zaun has pledged its support for Twitch in his quest, though it remains to be seen what Zaun\'s
            ulterior motives are in the matter.\n\n

        <item>The mystics of Ionia delve into the deepest mysteries of Valoran, pioneering the most inner depths of
            spirituality. Their adepts are some of the most devout proponents of enlightenment and harmony...but as is
            always the case, there are those who follow a very different path. Born in a grassy clearing under a red
            moon, Udyr has always been compelled by the primal drive within him. His will was not untempered, simply
            undomesticated. As a boy, he toiled on his father\'s farm, but he felt a much deeper connection with the
            mustangs that would graze in the distant fields than with the townsfolk who would visit. Oftentimes he was
            dragged into the house at night with a swat and a scolding when his parents would find him sleeping beneath
            the stars.\n\n

            On the day of his sixteenth birthday, Udyr bade his family farewell and struck a path to the east,
            determined to shed the trappings of \'civilized\' society. Freed of the shackles of cultural expectations,
            Udyr tapped into a well of inner ferocity he hadn\'t known before. His feral senses roiled to the surface
            and he let them overcome him. It was at this point in his life that Udyr truly lost his humanity. Poachers
            and travelers who entered his territory did so at terrible risk, and rarely managed to leave it.\n\n

            A monk on a long journey passed through his woods one day, and Udyr decided to scare him, leaping from a
            nearby brush. The monk casually turned and redirected Udyr to one side. Udyr, enraged, tried time and time
            again to best him, but the monk was unassailable. When Udyr was exhausted, the monk wordlessly beckoned him
            to follow, and together they walked in silence to the Hirana Monastery. The monks there took him in, and
            taught him to harness and control his animalistic fury...most of the time.

        <item>There are warriors who become great for their strength, cunning, or skill with arms. Others simply refuse
            to die. Urgot, once a great soldier of Noxus, may constitute a case in support of the latter. Prone to
            diving headlong into enemy battle lines, Urgot sewed chaos throughout the enemy ranks, often sustaining
            grievous injuries in the process. When his body was unable to weather further abuse, the crippled Urgot was
            delegated the position of High Executioner of Noxus. By this time, his hands had been ruined and he could
            barely walk. Scythe-like grafts affixed to his maimed limbs served to carry out his bloody work.\n\n

            Urgot finally met his end at what should have been his finest hour. Because of his military background, he
            often accompanied detachments into foreign territory to carry out judgment. After ambushing an enemy force,
            Jarvan IV, Crown Prince of Demacia, fell into the clutches of Urgot\'s division. Too far from Noxus to risk
            transporting their prize for ransom, Urgot prepared to dispose of their captive. At the final moment,
            however, the Dauntless Vanguard, led by Garen, the Might of Demacia, intervened, and Urgot was cut in two by
            the zealous warrior as he scrambled to free his Prince. In recognition of his service, the executioner\'s
            remains were remanded to the Bleak Academy for reanimation. A lifetime of abuse, however, had left his body
            in a catastrophic state; proving problematic to the necromancers\' craft. Professor Stanwick Pididly, the
            prevailing scholar of Zaun, offered a solution. Within Pididly\'s laboratories, a nightmarish new body was
            forged for Urgot. Now as much machine as man, Urgot arrived at the League of Legends in search of the man
            who ended his life; necromantic energies coursing through his metal veins.\n\n

        <item>The world is not always as civilized as people might think. There are still those who would follow the
            blackest paths of magic and become corrupted by the darker powers that flow through Runeterra. Shauna Vayne
            knows this fact well. As a young privileged girl in the heart of Demacia\'s elite, her father tried to
            convince her of the constabulary\'s ever-vigilant eye. Young and naive, she truly believed that her world
            was one of perfect safety, until one night, when a twisted witch took interest in her father. The malevolent
            woman overcame her father\'s conciliar guard, then tortured her family before murdering them. The young
            Shauna escaped only by hiding herself and then fleeing once the hag had departed, plagued by the screams of
            her loved ones as she ran. A burning hatred was born in her that day, one that could never be denied.\n\n

            Vayne was able to take care of herself using her father\'s money, and she began to train as soon as an
            instructor would have her as a student. By the time she was a fully grown woman, she had become a grim
            warrior. However, the fields of battle were not to be her home. Demacia needed a protector, one who hunted
            those lost to the darkness. Shauna used her family\'s contacts to become the first Night Hunter, and now her
            prowess is the stuff of legends. It is said that those who practice the black arts quake when they hear that
            the Night Hunter is on the prowl. Despite her crusade, Shauna has looked at the League of Legends in horror.
            There are champions who have clearly lost themselves to the blackest of magics, and who have been embraced
            within the League even though they should be put down for the safety of all. The time has come for the Night
            Hunter to execute her secret mission - to purge the League of Legends.\n\n

        <item>To most, thoughts of yordles do not conjure images to be feared. The easygoing half-pint race, though
            fierce, is often regarded with some degree of joviality. Their high-pitched voices and naturally cute forms
            inspire something of a protective instinct in the larger races, or at least bring to mind images of children
            playing at being adults. Every now and again, however, a yordle turns so bad that even at its small stature
            it strikes terror into the hearts of others. Veigar is one such twisted yordle. As a master of the magical
            black arts, as well as a corrupter of cosmic energy, he is one of the most powerful sorcerers on
            Valoran.\n\n

            As a child, Veigar was a normal yordle with one small exception - he had a deep curiosity for the world
            beyond Bandle City. The young yordle spent much of his time studying the rest of Valoran, and he jumped at
            the chance to join a business that traded with other major city-states. Unfortunately for both him and the
            world, a deal with Noxian trader turned into shady business and went bad; Veigar and his companions were
            subsequently set up to take the fall. Arrested by the authorities, he was imprisoned within the walls of
            Noxus for years. Such isolation is very dangerous for yordles - undoubtedly why his cruel jailers did such a
            thing - and Veigar was slowly driven mad.\n\n

            He eventually escaped, having become a twisted version of his former self. Instead of returning to his
            people and Bandle City, he sought tutelage from dark wizards across the land. With his demented will focused
            on one task, he quickly became a dangerous and powerful wizard in his own right. Now he seeks to end all
            conflict on Valoran by bringing all of the city-states to their knees, regardless of their affiliation. The
            League of Legends is the perfect tool to help him meet his ends - for now.\n\n

            Early in life, Viktor discovered his passion for science and invention, particularly in the field of
            mechanical automation. He attended Zaun\'s prestigious College of Techmaturgy and led the team that
            constructed Blitzcrank – a scientific breakthrough that he expected to vault him to the top of his
            profession. Unfortunately his triumph was usurped by Professor Stanwick, who stole credit for developing
            Blitzcrank\'s sentience and later used Viktor\'s research to revive Urgot. Viktor\'s appeals for justice
            fell on deaf ears, and he sank into a deep depression. He withdrew from the College and barricaded himself
            in his private laboratory, cutting all human ties. There, in secret, he conceived a project for which nobody
            else could claim credit. Desiring both to revolutionize his field and to eliminate the jealous human
            emotions which festered inside him, he engineered parts to replace and improve his own body.\n\n

            When Viktor re-emerged, almost no trace of the original man remained. Not only had he supplanted the
            majority of his anatomy, but his personality had changed. His previous hope to better society was replaced
            by an obsession with what he called \'the glorious evolution.\' He saw himself as the patron and pioneer of
            Valoran\'s future – a future in which man would renounce his flesh in favor of superior hextech
            augmentations. Though Viktor\'s initial appeals were met with heavy skepticism, scientists were confounded
            by the sophistication of his machinery. By integrating his mind with techmaturgical devices, he had been
            able to drastically accelerate the progress of his research. His transformation had stripped him of what he
            perceived as his emotional weaknesses, but there was some lingering residue of resentment against the

        <item>There is a temple hidden in the mountains between Noxus and the Tempest Flats, where the secrets of an
            ancient and terrifying sorcery are kept. The area surrounding the temple is littered with the exsanguinated
            corpses of those who have mistakenly wandered too close. These served only to pique the curiosity of
            Vladimir, when - in his youth - he trekked through these mountains during his flight from Noxus. A day
            earlier, the teenaged Vladimir had brutally murdered two boys his age, for no better reason than to enjoy
            the intoxicating scarlet bloom that surged forth. He realized immediately that he would never be able to
            suppress his murderous desires, and if he remained in Noxus, his foul deeds were sure to catch up with him.
            Without hesitation, he abandoned the city-state, and journeyed south.\n\n

            The trail of bodies led him to a crumbling stone temple. Inside he found an aging monk who appraised him
            with eyes of pure crimson. Vladimir surprised the monk by returning the wicked gaze with zeal. Recognizing
            the boy\'s sinister craving, the monk taught Vladimir how to manipulate and control the fluid of life, often
            practicing on passing travelers. When it came time for Vladimir to learn the final lesson, the monk warned
            that failure would result in death. Vladimir did not fail, but success bore a grisly surprise. During the
            ritual, every drop of the monk\'s blood was drawn from his body and fused with Vladimir\'s, imbuing him with
            his master\'s magical essence, and that of every hemomancer before him. Left alone and suddenly without
            purpose, Vladimir resolved to return to Noxus, demanding enrollment in the League to prove the supremacy of
            his craft. When the Noxian High Command observed the gruesome fates which befell the palace guards, they

            Ursine, Volibear devoted his life to the protection of his people and loyalty to his elder brother, the
            tribe\'s chief. When his brother was killed during a hunt on the tundra, the tribe looked to Volibear as his
            successor. It was an honor and a burden that Volibear had never expected, but he shouldered the charge with
            pride. However, by Ursine tradition, the tribe could not recognize Volibear as chief until he returned from
            a journey to the peak of their sacred mountain, a place forever shrouded in a thundering maelstrom. There,
            Ursine chieftains must speak to the storm itself, gaining clarity and wisdom to empower them as mighty
            leaders.\n\n

            Donning the chieftain\'s traditional armor and enchanted gauntlets, Volibear began the long and perilous
            climb up the slopes of the mountain. When he reached the peak and gazed into the raging storm above, he saw
            a horrific vision of a Freljord utterly consumed by war. Amidst the carnage, the Ursine fell dead upon a
            bloody battlefield. Believing the vision to be an omen of things to come if he did not act against them,
            Volibear traveled to the capitol of Freljord. The Ursine had not ventured across the southern mountains in
            centuries and his appearance was met with unease. However, Queen Ashe recognized Volibear as a wise and

            course of his infamous career as an alchemist, Warwick won many honors for his craft, not the least of which
            was a lucrative offer for service in the Noxian military during their campaigns against Ionia. Sequestered
            in his labs far from the front lines, Warwick and his apprentice Singed toiled relentlessly to manufacture
            all manner of appalling concoctions for the Noxian army. So potent was his art that even the greatest of
            Ionia\'s healers - under the leadership of the Starchild Soraka - struggled to combat the poisons and
            chemical weapons generated by his despicable mind. Warwick\'s reign of terror grew so horrific that his very
            name became a curse in the eyes of his Ionian foes, and they began referring to him only as \'the
            Deathmaker.\'\n\n

            But even one under the protection of the Noxian High Command is not wholly beyond the reach of retribution.
            For as Soraka strode across the myriad of death and destruction left in the wake of one of Warwick\'s
            chemical attacks, her heart finally gave way. She called down the wrath of the cosmos on Warwick, wishing
            that his form should mirror the cruelty in his heart - a curse that would come at the price of her aspiring
            divinity. Within his laboratory, a terrible thirst took hold over Warwick. As his apprentice looked on in
            horror, Warwick threw open the doors to his bastion and sprinted off toward parts unknown, a bloodcurdling
            howling marking his passage. He had become a werewolf; a wild, murderous beast. Today, the Blood Hunter

            strength and power it had contained. Kong was driven by an unquenchable desire for greatness. He sought out
            every beast and monster the Plague Jungles could offer, eager to find a worthy opponent, but none offered
            the challenge he craved. He asked the sage for advice, and learned about a legend of hairless monkeys to the
            north who, with wits and might, had bent the world to their will.\n\n

            Wukong left, journeying north, determined to discover if the legend was true. He crossed the Southern Wastes
            and then the Great Barrier. On his way, he happened upon Master Yi, who was deep in meditation. Kong asked
            him who the strongest warrior in the north was, and Yi told him about the League of Legends. The tale
            intoxicated Kong, a place where he could battle the strongest fighters in the world was, to him, paradise.
            Kong asked Yi to introduce him to this League, and to teach him the ways of humans, so that he could be a
            fitting champion. In return, he would honor Yi by using Yi\'s Wuju style to become the greatest warrior
            Runeterra had ever seen. Admiring his passion, Yi agreed, but under the condition that Kong would one day
            teach the lessons of Wuju to a pupil of his own. In the spirit of this agreement, he renamed Kong
            \'Wukong,\' and gave him a weapon suited to his unusual nature - an enchanted staff that the young Doran had
            crafted. The weapon was an unrivalled masterpiece. Guided by Yi, Wukong joined the League of Legends to
            prove himself as the best, and to show the world the true power of Wuju.\n\n

        <item>In the ancient civilization of Shurima, the mage called Xerath practiced magic with undying passion. He
            believed that with enough magical power, he could gaze into the heart of Runeterra to know the secrets of
            history and the universe beyond. Such magic was beyond the limitations of a mortal body, but Xerath
            obsessively pursued a path to infinite power nonetheless. With every breakthrough he grew more and more
            powerful, yet not without consequence. Xerath\'s increasing arcane abilities wrought havoc on his physical
            form. Desperate, he undertook a dangerous ritual to transcend his dying body. The outcome would be
            immortality or self-destruction. Violent magic unleashed during the ritual caused devastation throughout
            Shurima, but when the dust settled, Xerath emerged as an ascended being of pure arcane energy.\n\n

            Free of flesh and bone, Xerath held nearly infinite power at his command. However, in the wake of his
            chaotic ritual, the mages of Shurima feared his careless disregard for life would bring ruin to the kingdom.
            After a terrible struggle they subdued Xerath, but they could not destroy his ascended form. Instead they
            trapped him within an enchanted sarcophagus and sealed him in an underground tomb. Eons passed,
            civilizations rose and fell, and Xerath\'s imprisonment was lost to memory. For centuries, Xerath\'s vast
            power tore away at the sarcophagus and weakened its spell. Finally, he willed forth a burst of magic that
            shattered his prison, but its core remained, containing Xerath and his power within its broken pieces.
            Seeking to rid himself of this burden, he was drawn to the magic of Valoran\'s nexuses and found he could
            absorb their power. Yet the nexuses had gatekeepers: petty mages known as summoners. Xerath knew his key to
            true freedom from his prison lay in gaining their trust, and he offered his power to the League of
            Legends.\n\n

            \'I have no need for vengeance. Time has brought ruin to the mages of Shurima and I alone remain.\ – Xerath,

        <item>Whenever Jarvan III, the king of Demacia, delivers one of his rallying speeches from the glinting marble
            balcony atop the Royal Palace, Xin Zhao is at his side. Coined the Seneschal of Demacia, Xin Zhao is the
            personal steward of the Lightshield Dynasty. His enigmatic, silent vigil has led to an abundance of
            conjecture concerning his \'secret life\' and origins. Whether it\'s \'Zaun double-agent\' tendered at the
            dinner table or \'indebted rune mage\' mused in the editorials of the \'Demacian Constant\', Xin Zhao
            betrays no hints to sate the curiosity of the masses... for good reason.\n\n

            Prior to the formation of the League, Noxus was renowned for a spectacle called The Fleshing. It was a
            gladiatorial event with a cruel twist: as a fighter won matches, his number of opponents (generally
            prisoners of war) fought simultaneously would increase. This meant eventual death for every contender, but
            with unparalleled glory. Xin Zhao, known then as Viscero, was slated to face 300 soldiers, nearly six times
            the previous record. This was clearly meant to be his final match. Jarvan II, hearing of this unprescedented
            feat, infiltrated the arena to offer him an alternative: serve Demacia and punish those who ultimately
            sentence him to death in exchange for his freedom. Xin Zhao accepted, astonished that a king would risk his
            own life on his behalf. Under the cover of a prearranged Demacian assault on Noxus, Jarvan liberated Xin
            Zhao and his 300 opponents. During their retreat, Xin Zhao took a poisoned dart meant for Jarvan. This act
            of loyalty, from a man who vowed no allegiance, earned Xin Zhao a spot at his side until the day the king
            died. Now in the service of his son, Jarvan III, Xin Zhao is stepping into a new ring - the Fields of
            Justice - to fight for his adopted country and to honor the legacy of the man who gave purpose to his
            life.\n\n

        <item>The work of gravediggers is essential amongst the living, but invaluable in the Shadow Isles. There are
            many shades of death there, and each is embraced rather than feared or reviled. One can only ascend from one
            state to the next with the magical aid of a skilled professional. At the end of the first Rune War, Yorick
            Mori made his living as a gravedigger. His family owned and maintained the Final Rest Memorial, one of the
            oldest cemeteries in Valoran. The shovel he employed for his work had been passed down for generations. Each
            gravedigger taught his son that this shovel was imbued with the spirit of every forefather, and that those
            spirits would protect him during the long lonely nights amongst the tombstones. To his eternal regret,
            Yorick died without an heir, bringing the proud Mori line to a close. His body was interred with his shovel
            in the family mausoleum, and the Final Rest Memorial soon fell to ruin. Death, however, was not the end
            Yorick had expected.\n\n

            Yorick emerged on the haunted shores of the Shadow Isles - not quite dead, definitely not alive - still
            clutching his beloved shovel. He soon learned that with it he could act as a ferryman for the Isles\' undead
            denizens, helping them climb death\'s many-tiered ladder. This proved a curse, as a gravedigger must \'bury
            his quota\' before he too can ascend, or so the legend goes. No one knows what \'his quota\' is. Yorick dug
            tirelessly, waiting in vain for the day when he would be freed of his burden. As decades turned to
            centuries, the shame of his failures came to a head. He returned to Valoran to find his corpse, convinced
            that salvation might be buried with it. When he arrived, no trace remained of either the mausoleum or the
            memorial. Hope nearly lost, he discovered the League of Legends, and there saw an opportunity to immortalize
            the family name he allowed to be forgotten ages ago.\n\n

        <item>In the wastelands of Urtistan, there was once a great city. It perished long ago in a terrible Rune War,
            like most of the lands below the Great Barrier. Nevertheless, one man survived: a sorcerer named Zilean.
            Being obsessed with time, it was only fitting that he dwelled in the city\'s Clock Tower. As the havoc of
            the war neared his home, Zilean experimented with powerful temporal magic to divine all possible futures,
            hoping to discover a peaceful solution. But Zilean\'s enchantments affected his perception of the passage of
            time, and he was in a contemplative stasis when Urtistan was set upon by an entire phalanx of dark
            summoner-knights of unknown affiliation. By the time he realized his error, Urtistan was nothing more than
            smoldering debris. The summoners who were responsible for its destruction had wisely left the Clock Tower
            unharmed, both to avoid drawing Zilean\'s attention and to torment him for his oversight.\n\n

            Zilean barely had time to grieve the momentous loss before he learned that his dangerous research had a
            cruel side effect: chrono-displasia. This mystical disease granted him immortality, but detached his
            consciousness from its anchor in the present time. He now mentally drifts through time, from any point he
            has already lived to the present, unable to impact the events which unfold. The most torturous aspect of
            this curse is that Zilean sometimes experiences Urtistan as it once was and the rest of the time resides in
            its lonely ruins. Only the powerful summoning magic employed by members of the League of Legends has been
            able to treat this condition, and Zilean has joined in hopes of finding a cure, and thereafter a way to save
            his people.\n\n

            \'There is no greater grief than for a loss that is yet to come.\'

    <!-- Role explanations-->
    <string name="assassin">Assassin: Champions which specialize in killing their enemies quickly. These champions
        usually are physical attackers and are DPS-based or are AP burst oriented. All of them have some form of
        invisibility or sudden ambushing ability. They should focus on items that with increase the damage they put out
        over a short period of time.
    </string>
    <string name="carry">Carry: Champions that generally start off weaker than other champions, but become gradually
        powerful as they gain levels and items. Most carries have skills, passive or active, that scale with their
        stats, such as an increase in Base Damage and Attack Speed, and rely mostly on their regular attack to dish out
        damage. Carry champions are extremely effective late-game at "carrying" the team to victory, either by killing
        off key players on the enemy team, controlling elements of gameplay, deal large damage in team fights or
        supporting the team in attacking.
    </string>
    <string name="fighter">Fighter: Champions that have aspects of DPSing and tanking, combining the survivability of a
        tank and the damage of a DPS or a caster. Although they don\'t quite match up to their specialized counterparts
        in either role, they still excel in both. In a team fight, they usually are anti-carries. It is usually a good
        idea for these champions to do battle against the appropriate carries as they can take a good amount of the
        damage that the carry puts out but also deal damage back.
    </string>
    <string name="jungler">Jungler: Champions that can easily farm monsters in the jungle at an early stage in the game
        and can typically take out minions waves quickly. They usually excel at taking down opponents when they can
        catch them off guard in lane. Some champions jungle because their lane phase isn\'t that strong (easily
        harassed, low early mana pool) and others are capable of both.
    </string>
    <string name="mage">Mage: Champions who aren\'t focused so much on autoattacking as much as using abilities that are
        greatly affected by ability power. Their autoattacks are typically ranged. Some are meant to deal a high amount
        of damage in a short period of time (burst casters/burst mages) while others are a little tanky and usually deal
        damage over time.
    </string>
    <string name="melee">Melee: Champions that have a melee basic attack, so they have to be very close to their target
        in order to do damage. They have usually more health, armor, and magic resistance than ranged champions. Most
        Tanks and Fighters are melee combatants.
    </string>
    <string name="pusher">Pusher: Champions that can quickly kill minion waves and destroy turrets/inhibitors in a short
        amount of time. Typically, champions that destroy turrets/inhibitors have pets and/or AoE abilities and/or a
        high amount of attack speed.
    </string>
    <string name="ranged">Ranged: Champions whose basic attack can cause damage at a distance (see range), allowing them
        to avoid many harmful risks and increasing their flee capability. Ranged Champions are divided into two
        sub-catagories: Mages and DPS. Mages have a weak attack and focus on damage spells or support, while DPS
        champions posses highly damaging attacks. Most ranged champions possess less than average health, regardless of
        role.
    </string>
    <string name="recommended">Recommended: Champions whose skills don\'t involve any complicated mechanics and playing
        them effectively does not require extensive knowledge of the other champions.
    </string>
    <string name="stealth">Stealth: An ability that lets the Champion become invisible to enemies (other than when near
        turrets, vision wards, and enemy champions with an Oracles buff).
    </string>
    <string name="support">Support: Champions whose skills are meant to directly aid the rest of the team. They can
        either babysit a hero to make laning easier for them by providing healing, buffs, or map control, applying
        debuffs to the enemy team, or a combination of the above. The most common ability for a support champion is
        providing an ally with a shield of some kind. These champions usually rely on their skills more than their
        auto-attack.
    </string>
    <string name="tank">Tank: Champions who are designed to take massive amounts of damage. Tanks are usually champions
        that sport high amounts of health, armor, and magic resistance. If left alone, tanks are able to accumulate high
        amounts of damage or disables on their foes. In battle, this type of champion is usually expected to start (or
        at least be in the front of) the team fight and stay in; soaking up damage, helping focus certain enemies, and
        protecting vulnerable allies.
